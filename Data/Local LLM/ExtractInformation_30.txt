In this study, the authors report on the formation of 2D covalent networks on surfaces through the condensation of laminar polyester. The precursor molecules are laminar polyester molecules, and the substrates are Au(111) surfaces. The temperature at which the reaction takes place is 575 K. The products of the reaction are porous, and the pore walls are functionalized through the ester bridges. The morphological characteristics of the products can be determined based on the shape of the product molecules on the surface.


Precursor Molecules: Iodine- and bromine-functionalized
Substrate: Au(111)
Annealing/Reaction Temperature: C/C0Br and C/C0I cleavage temperature thresholds are vastly different, allowing for two different polymerization routes to be compared: hierarchical and direct polymerization.
Products: The morphological characteristics of the products can be determined based on the shape of the product molecules on the surface.

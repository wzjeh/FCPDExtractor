Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
AEB1 | Au(111) | Room Temperature | 1,4-Regioisomer | 2D |
Note: The precursor molecule used was AEB1, which was deposited onto the surface. The reaction occurred under mild conditions at room temperature, providing exclusively the 1,4-regioisomer product 2. The reaction mechanism and the observed regioselectivity were clarified through DFT simulations.

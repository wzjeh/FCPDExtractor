The table shows that the precursor molecules used in the experiment were brominated poly(dodecyl sulfone) (BPDSC) and phenyl-SO2-phenyl (PSP). The substrates used were Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. The reactions were carried out at a temperature of 300 K. The products of the reactions were poly(dodecyl sulfone) (PDS) and phenyl-SO2-phenyl (PSP). The dimensionality of the product molecules was 2D + 0D for both

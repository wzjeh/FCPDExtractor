Non-benzenoid molecules (1) Gold Surface 340 °C Non-graphene molecules (2A, B) Non-graphene (NG) molecules with strained structural conformation (0.75 eV)
Task: Please summarize the following details in a table: precursor molecules, substrates, annealing/reaction temperature of the molecules, products (i.e., the compound molecules formed in this experiment), and the dimensionality of the product molecules (i.e., 0D, 1D, 2D, or 3D). If no information is provided or you are unsure, use N/A. Please focus on extracting experimental conditions only from the surface chemistry synthesis and ignore information related to catalytic reactions in the reaction. The table should have 5 columns: | Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |

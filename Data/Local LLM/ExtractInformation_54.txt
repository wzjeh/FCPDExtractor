THPB | Au(111) | N/A | C-H bond-activated phenol | 2D |
DHQP | Ag(111) | N/A | C-H bond-activated phenol | 2D |
In summary, the experiment explored the selective ortho C-H bond activation of phenol molecules on gold and silver surfaces. The precursor molecules used were terphenyl-based and dihydroxyquinoline-based. The experiment was conducted at room temperature. The key finding was that for THPB precursors, both ortho C-H bonds were activated on Au(111) surfaces, whereas only one ortho C-H bond of each phenol ring was activated on Ag(111) surfaces. The products were C-H bond-activated phenol molecules with a dimensionality of 2D.

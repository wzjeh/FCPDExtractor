
Precursor: Au carboxylate complex
Substrate: Au(111) surface
Temperature: 124Â°C
Products: 2D metal-organic polymers
Dimensions: 2D (Simplified as 2)
Note: The precursor molecules are deposited at sub-monolayer (ca. 40%) coverage. The experiment uses a 2D metal-organic framework. The products form an ordered structure on the surface. The morphological characteristics of the products can be determined based on the shape of the product molecules on the surface.

Precursor: Precursor molecules are not mentioned in the text.
Substrate: The substrate is not mentioned in the text.
Temperature: The exact temperature values are not provided in the text, but it is mentioned that the precursor molecules are prepared in situ on the substrate via a Glaser coupling reaction.
Product: The resulting product is a self-assembled structure confined by the Au(111) herringbone reconstruction, which is driven by hydrogen bonding of the acid groups and van der Waals interactions between the aromatic backbones.
Dimensions: The morphological characteristics of the product can be determined based on the shape of the product molecules on the surface.

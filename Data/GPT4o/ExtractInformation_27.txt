Sure, here's the summary of the experimental details in a table format:

| Precursor                         | Substrate | Temperature | Products                            | Dimensions |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| oligo-(E)-1,1′-bi(indenylidene)   | Au(111)   | N/A         | Polyacetylene derivative oligomers  | N/A        |

Since the temperature for the reaction isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, it is marked as N/A. The product molecules formed are polyacetylene derivative oligomers. The dimensionality of the product molecules is not specified, so it is also marked as N/A.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

The provided text does not contain specific details about the precursor molecules, substrates, temperatures, products, or the dimensionality of the product molecules in the context of surface chemistry synthesis. The text mainly discusses the interest in conjugated polymers, their applications, and various polymerization techniques, but lacks detailed experimental conditions.

Sure, here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor                    | Substrate  | Temperature | Products            | Dimensions |
|------------------------------|------------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| 3-chloro-4-isocyano-1,1â€²-biphenyl (Cl-ICBP) | Ag(111)     | 333K        | Triaza[3]radialene | 2D         |
|                              | Ag(111)     | 373K        | N/A                 | N/A        |

Note: The temperature listed corresponds to the conditions under which each process occurs. The first temperature (333K) is for the formation of the triaza[3]radialene product, while the second temperature (373K) is for the annealing process, which results in the disappearance of the regular 2D structures.

Sure, I'll extract the relevant experimental conditions and summarize them in the table format you requested. However, the provided text does not seem to contain complete information on precursor molecules, substrates, annealing/reaction temperatures, products, or dimensions related to the experiment. This might require additional context or sections from the document. 

Given the provided text, I'll outline a skeleton structure of the table and fill in the details where available:

```markdown
| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |
```

Please provide more specific details or additional parts of the document to accurately complete the table with the required experimental conditions.

Sure, I'll summarize the provided details in a table format as requested. Here is the table with the required columns:

| Precursor     | Substrate       | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Cl-ICBP       | Ag(111)         | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

Since the provided text contains limited information about the precursor molecules, substrates, annealing/reaction temperatures, products, and dimensions, I have filled in the table with the available data. If there were more specific details available in the text, they would be included accordingly.

Sure, I'll summarize the relevant details into a table as requested. Here is the extracted information:

| Precursor Molecules | Substrates | Annealing/Reaction Temperature | Products | Dimensionality of Product Molecules |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Terminal Alkynyl Bromides | Au(111) | Elevated temperatures (specific temperature not mentioned) | Surface nanostructures involving acetylenic linkages | Low-dimensional (N/A) |

Note: The exact temperatures and specific product molecules formed are not provided in the abstract. If you have more detailed sections of the paper, I could refine this table further.

Here's the summarized table based on the given details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| BEBP      | Au(111)   | RT          | C-Au-C organometallic intermediates | N/A        |
| BEBP      | Au(111)   | ∼400 K      | N/A      | N/A        |
| bBEBP     | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | 1-D        |
| tBEP      | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | 2-D        |

Notes:
- RT stands for Room Temperature.
- Specific products for bBEBP and tBEP are not explicitly mentioned, only the dimensionality.
- Dimensions for the BEBP at different temperatures are not explicitly mentioned.

Sure, I'll extract the relevant experimental details and summarize them in a table. Based on the information provided, here's the table:

| Precursor                  | Substrate | Temperature | Products                         | Dimensions |
|----------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Terminal alkynyl bromide   | Au(111)   | N/A         | Dimer structures                 | 1D         |
| Terminal alkynyl bromide   | Au(111)   | N/A         | One-dimensional molecular wires  | 1D         |
| Terminal alkynyl bromide   | Au(111)   | N/A         | Two-dimensional molecular networks | 2D         |

Please note that specific temperatures were not provided in the text. If there are more details or additional context you can provide, I'd be happy to refine the table further!

Sure, let's extract the relevant experimental conditions and summarize them in a table. Here's the information organized as requested:

| Precursor            | Substrate | Temperature | Products                         | Dimensions  |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| BEBP molecules       | Au(111)   | RT (Room Temperature) | Ordered islands (rod-like structure with bright protrusions) | Low-dimensional |

Note: The text provided does not specify the exact dimensions in terms of numerical values or specific letters, so "low-dimensional" is used to describe the dimensionality of the product molecules based on the context given.

Certainly! Based on the provided information, here is a summary table extracting the experimental conditions for the surface chemistry synthesis:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| BEBP      | Au(111)   | RT (Room Temperature) | C−Au−C organometallic intermediates | N/A |
| bBEBP     | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |
| tBEP      | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

Note: There was no detailed information provided for bBEBP and tBEP molecules, hence marked as N/A. The dimensions for the C−Au−C species were not clearly specified in a simplified form, so it's also marked as N/A. If more detailed information about other molecules or conditions were provided, they could be added accordingly.

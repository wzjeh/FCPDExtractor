**Note:** The table focuses on the provided experimental conditions related to surface chemistry synthesis and ignores catalytic reactions as requested.

Here is the requested summary in a table:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| CHP       | Copper    | N/A         | TBC      | N/A        |

Given the provided information, only the details about CHP (cyclodehydrogenation of CHP to TBC) and the substrate (copper) are explicitly mentioned. The temperature and dimensions of the product molecules are not provided in the text, so they are marked as N/A.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Polyphenylene precursors | Cu(111) | N/A | Large PAHs (nanographenes) | N/A |
| Cyclic polyphenylene cyclohexa-o-p-o-p-o-p-phenylene (CHP) | Cu(111) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

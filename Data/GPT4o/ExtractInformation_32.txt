| 1,6-diaminohexane (>99%, Fluka)                                           | Au(111)     | N/A         | Covalently interlinked 2D polymers | 2D         |

**Notes:**
- The substrate used in both cases is Au(111).
- The temperature for annealing is specified as 850K for the trialdehyde precursor.
- The products are covalently interlinked 2D polymers.
- The dimensionality of the product molecules is 2D.

Sure, here's a summary table based on the given text:

| Precursor          | Substrate | Temperature     | Products         | Dimensions |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Trialdehyde        | Surface   | 400–450 K       | Covalently linked trialdehydes and alkyl chains | 2D         |
| Trialdehyde        | Surface   | 400 K           | Covalently linked trialdehydes and alkyl chains | 2D         |

Sure, here is the detailed summary in a table format based on the provided information:

| Precursor          | Substrate       | Temperature     | Products                          | Dimensions |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Intact molecules   | Surface         | Heated          | Activated building blocks         | N/A        |
| Activated molecules| Surface (room temp)| Room temperature | Covalently connected nanostructures | N/A        |
| Porphyrin with four phenyl legs | N/A | Thermal dissociation | Activated (most likely radical) fragments | N/A |

Note: The information provided does not include explicit details on the exact temperatures or the dimensionality of the product molecules, so those fields are marked as N/A where applicable.

Sure, here's the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | N/A       | N/A         | Covalently bonded porphyrin nanostructure | N/A |

Unfortunately, the provided text does not give explicit details about the precursor molecules, substrates, or the exact annealing/reaction temperature. The product mentioned is a covalently bonded porphyrin nanostructure, but its dimensionality isn't specified in simplified numbers and letters. Therefore, I've marked those fields as N/A (Not Available).

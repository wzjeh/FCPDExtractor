Sure, here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1 and 2   | Pt(111)   | 540 °C      | Compound 2 | N/A        |
| 3         | Pt(111)   | 590 °C      | N/A        | N/A        |

**Additional Notes:**
- The substrate, Pt(111), was cleaned by repeated cycles of sputtering with Ar+ ions at 600 °C and annealing at 960 °C.
- Deposition was performed with the substrate at room temperature.
- Evaporators were degassed at least 14 hours before deposition at 20 °C below the sublimation temperature.

| Precursor | Substrate   | Temperature | Products   | Dimensions |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| C60       | Au(111)     | N/A         | Very little fullerene | N/A        |
| C60       | Cu(100)     | 380 °C      | Triangular-shaped molecules | N/A        |
| C60       | Cu(100)     | 480 °C      | No fullerene formation | N/A        |

**Notes:**
- The information related to Pt(111) and other catalytic properties has been ignored as per the instructions.
- The specific products and their dimensions are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, hence marked as N/A where appropriate.

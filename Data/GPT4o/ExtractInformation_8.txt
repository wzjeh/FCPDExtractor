Here is the summary of the requested details in a table format:

| Precursor       | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Azulene-derivative PAHs | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

It appears that the specific details requested (precursor molecules, substrates, annealing/reaction temperature of the molecules, products, and the dimensionality of the product molecules) were not provided in the excerpt you shared. If there is more specific information in another part of the text, please provide those details so I can complete the table accurately.

Here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DAPh      | Cu(001)   | N/A         | 4, 5, 6  | 0.0 Å, 1.0 Å, 1.9 Å |
| DAPyr     | Cu(001)   | N/A         | 4, 5, 6  | 0.0 Å, 1.0 Å, 1.9 Å |

**Notes:**
- The exact annealing/reaction temperature is not mentioned in the provided text, hence marked as N/A.
- The dimensions provided are based on the simplified numbers plus letters as requested.

Here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DAPh 1    | Cu(001)   | N/A         | DAPyr 4  | 2D         |

**Notes:**
- The precursor molecule is DAPh 1.
- The substrate used is Cu(001).
- The exact annealing/reaction temperature is not provided in the text.
- The product formed is DAPyr 4.
- The product molecule adopts a planar (2D) configuration.

| Trihydrosilane 3| Cu(111)   | r.t.        | trans-poly-3   | 2D         |

**Notes:**
- r.t. stands for room temperature.
- Hydrosilane 1 did not lead to polymeric structures on either substrate.
- Dihydrosilane 2 formed different stereoisomers on Au(111) and Cu(111).
- Trihydrosilane 3 polymerized only on Cu(111) and formed the same stereoisomer as dihydrosilane 2.

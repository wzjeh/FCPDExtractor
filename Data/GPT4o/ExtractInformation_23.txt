Note: The specific temperatures for the reactions are not provided in the text, hence marked as N/A. Similarly, the exact dimensions of the product molecules are not mentioned, so they are also marked as N/A.

Sure! Here's a summary of the provided details in a table format:

| Precursor                               | Substrate | Temperature | Products                                                    | Dimensions |

Since the exact temperature and some other details were not explicitly provided in the text, I have marked them as N/A. If more details become available, the table can be updated accordingly.

Sure! Here is the summary in a table format based on the given information:

| Precursor Molecules | Substrates | Annealing/Reaction Temperature | Products | Dimensionality |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| N/A                 | Single-crystal metal surfaces | N/A                           | Covalently interlinked nanostructures | N/A            |

Please note that the provided text does not specify detailed information about specific precursor molecules, exact reaction temperatures, or specific products. Therefore, N/A has been used where the information is not provided or is unclear from the text. If you have more detailed experimental data or specific examples, I can help further refine the table.

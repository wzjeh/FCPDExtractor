Sure, here's a summary in table format based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 2         | Au(111)   | N/A         | Linear Chains | N/A        |
| 2         | Ag(111)   | N/A         | Oligomers     | N/A        |

Note: The provided text did not include specific temperatures or detailed dimensionality of the product molecules, so these are marked as N/A.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1         | Au(111)   | 125 °C      | Oligomers| N/A        |

**Notes:**
- The precursor molecule is referred to as "1".
- The substrate used is Au(111).
- The annealing/reaction temperature is around 125 °C.
- The product formed is oligomers.
- Dimensionality information for the product molecules is not explicitly provided in the text.

Sure, I can help with that. Here is the summary in a table format:

| Precursor          | Substrate   | Temperature           | Products | Dimensions |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------|----------|------------|
| Diethynyl-substituted p-system 1 | Au(111)    | Room Temperature       | N/A      | 2D         |

Please note that some information is either not provided or not explicitly clear in the given text. If you have more details or specific parts of the document you want me to focus on, please let me know!

Sure! Here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor Molecules | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Organic precursor molecules | Metal surfaces | Ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions | Robust functional materials | 2D |

Please note that the exact details for each of the precursor molecules, substrates, and specific temperatures were not provided in the given text. The general process described involves on-surface synthesis under UHV conditions, typically monitored by STM. If more specific details are available in the full text, those would need to be included for a detailed summary.

Certainly! Here's a summary of the details provided in a table format:

| Precursor   | Substrate | Temperature      | Products  | Dimensions         |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Alkyne 1    | Au(111)   | 123–140 °C       | Oligomers | 40 nm × 40 nm      |

This table focuses on the experimental conditions mentioned, specifically related to the surface chemistry synthesis. Information not relevant to this context has been omitted as per your instructions.

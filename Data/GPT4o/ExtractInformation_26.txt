Here is the summary of the experimental conditions in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| DEBP      | Au(111)   | N/A         | Polymeric network (2D) | 2D |

Notes:
- The precursor molecule is DEBP.
- The substrate used is Au(111).
- The specific annealing/reaction temperature is not provided in the given text (noted as N/A).
- The product formed is a polymeric network.
- The dimensionality of the product molecules is 2D.

Sure, here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|

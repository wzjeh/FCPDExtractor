Here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor                             | Substrate  | Temperature       | Products          | Dimensions |
|---------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| (E)-3,4-bis(4-iodophenyl)-1,6-diphenyl-3-hexen-1,5-diyne (1b) | Au(111)    | 20°C              | Polymer (10)       | N/A        |
| Polymer (10)                          | N/A        | 210°C (20 min)    | Intermediate (11) | N/A        |
| Intermediate (11)                     | N/A        | 370°C (20 min)    | Graphene nanoribbons (12 and 13) | N/A        |

**Notes:**
- The precursor molecule is (E)-3,4-bis(4-iodophenyl)-1,6-diphenyl-3-hexen-1,5-diyne (1b).
- The substrate used for the reaction is Au(111).
- The initial reaction temperature is 20°C, producing polymer (10).
- Subsequent annealing at 210°C and 370°C yields intermediates and final products (graphene nanoribbons).

Here's the summary in table format, focusing on the experimental conditions for the surface chemistry synthesis:

| Precursor        | Substrate | Temperature    | Products                  | Dimensions |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|------------|
| Enediyne 1a      | Au(111)   | Moderate       | N/A                       | N/A        |
| Diiodoenediyne 1b| Au(111)   | Ambient        | 1D chains (via Ullmann-like coupling) | 1D         |

Note: The table is based on the information provided, which primarily focuses on the use of enediyne 1a and diiodoenediyne 1b on a Au(111) substrate, with moderate and ambient temperatures, respectively. The products listed are as specific as the text allows.

Sure, I can help with that. Based on the provided text, I'll extract the relevant experimental conditions related to surface chemistry synthesis and ignore information related to catalytic reactions. Here is the table:

| Precursor        | Substrate     | Temperature | Products                     | Dimensions |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Alkynes          | Metal surface | N/A         | Intermediates                | N/A        |
| Halo- or silylalkynes | Metal surface | N/A         | Homocoupling products        | N/A        |
| Alkynylcarboxylic acids | Metal surface | N/A         | Coupling products             | N/A        |

Sure, based on the provided text, here is a summary of the experimental conditions in a table format:

| Precursor                | Substrate | Temperature           | Products                       | Dimensions |
|--------------------------|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| Aldehyde-related species | Au(111)   | Room temperature (RT)  | Vinylene moiety products       | N/A        |
| N/A                      | N/A       | Subsequent thermal treatment | Oxygenated side-products excluded | N/A        |

Note: The provided text mentions the general experimental conditions and outcomes but does not specify all the details for each column. Where specific information was not available, I have indicated "N/A".

Here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor                 | Substrate | Temperature | Products                               | Dimensions |
|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| Terephthalaldehyde derivative | Au(111)   | N/A         | Polyphenylene vinylene oligomer        | N/A        |

Note: The temperature details were not provided in the excerpt, so it has been marked as N/A. Similarly, the exact dimensions of the product molecules were not specified in the provided text.

Sure, here is the summarized table based on the provided information:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Aldehydes | N/A       | N/A         | C–C coupling products | Tunable optoelectronic properties |

Since specific details such as the exact precursor aldehydes, substrates, and annealing/reaction temperatures weren't provided in the text, I have marked them as N/A where applicable. The product and dimensions were inferred from the context provided.

| Precursor    | Substrate | Temperature | Products    | Dimensions |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| DTA-SAM      | Au(111)   | 250°C       | Oligomers   | N/A        |

Note: The article mentions the use of DTA-SAM on an Au(111) substrate with an annealing temperature of 250°C, resulting in the formation of disordered oligomers. The dimensionality of the product molecules is not explicitly provided.

Sure, I'll summarize the details in the requested table format.

| Precursor                    | Substrate | Temperature | Products    | Dimensions |
|------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 2,5-dihexyl-terephthalaldehyde (DTA 1) | Au(111)   | N/A         | p-PPV 2    | N/A        |

There is no specific information provided about the exact annealing/reaction temperature or the dimensionality of the product molecules in the text.

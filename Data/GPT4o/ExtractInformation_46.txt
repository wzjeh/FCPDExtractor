Sure, here is the summary in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | Ag(111)   | Mild thermal activation | Discrete compounds or polymeric networks | Low-dimensional |

**Notes:**
- The exact precursor molecules are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.
- The substrate mentioned is Ag(111).
- The temperature is described as "mild thermal activation."
- The products are discrete compounds or polymeric networks with a conjugated backbone.
- The dimensionality is described as low-dimensional nano-architectures.

If you have more specific details from other parts of the document, they could be added to make the table more complete.

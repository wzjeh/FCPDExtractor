#### Notes:
- **PA**: Phenylacetylene
- **IB**: Iodobenzene
- **DPA**: Diphenylacetylene
- **DPDA**: Diphenyldiacetylene
- **BP**: Biphenyl
- **Au(111)**: Gold (111) surface

If there are any additional details or corrections needed, please let me know!

Here is the requested summary in a table format:

| Precursor       | Substrate | Temperature | Products                          | Dimensions |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Phenylacetylene | Au(111)   | N/A         | Diphenyldiacetylene, Biphenyl, Diphenylacetylene | N/A        |
| Iodobenzene     | Au(111)   | N/A         | Diphenyldiacetylene, Biphenyl, Diphenylacetylene | N/A        |

- **Precursor**: The starting molecules used in the experiment.
- **Substrate**: The surface on which the reaction occurs.
- **Temperature**: The temperature at which the reaction is carried out.
- **Products**: The compounds formed as a result of the reaction.
- **Dimensions**: The dimensionality of the product molecules (not explicitly provided in the text).

Note: The temperature and dimensions weren't specified in the provided text, so they are marked as N/A.

Certainly! Below is the summarized information in a table format based on the provided abstract:

| Precursor          | Substrate | Temperature | Products                      | Dimensions |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Phenylacetylene    | Au(111)   | N/A         | Biphenyl                      | 2D         |
| Iodobenzene        | Au(111)   | N/A         | Diphenyldiacetylene           | 2D         |
| Phenylacetylene + Iodobenzene | Au(111) | N/A | Diphenylacetylene | 2D         |
| Phenylacetylene + Iodobenzene | Roughened Au(111) | N/A | None (inert) | N/A |

Note:
- The exact annealing/reaction temperature is not provided in the abstract, so it is marked as N/A.
- The products were identified as biphenyl, diphenyldiacetylene, and diphenylacetylene.
- The dimensions are considered 2D based on the typical surface reactions on Au(111).

Here is a summary of the experimental conditions extracted from the provided text:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | Au(111)   | 550 K       | N/A      | N/A        |

The text provided does not specify the precursor molecules, the exact products formed, or their dimensionality. It only mentions the substrate (Au(111)) and the annealing temperature (550 K). If more detailed information about the precursor molecules, products, and their dimensions is required, additional context or data would be necessary.

| 1 (dibromomethylene-functionalized precursor) | Au(111) | 150–250°C | Ethynylene-bridged anthracene polymer | 1D |
| 1 (dibromomethylene-functionalized precursor) | Au(111) | 165°C | N/A | N/A |

Note: The table summarizes the experimental conditions for the formation of ethynylene-bridged π-conjugated 1D polymers under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions on an Au(111) surface. The product and dimensionality for the scenario where the precursor is sublimed onto an already hot gold surface kept at 165°C are not provided in the text.

| 5         | Au(111)   | 200°C       | diindeno[2,1-a:2′,1′-g]-s-indacene, diindeno[2,1-a:1′,2′-h]-s-indacene derivatives, homochiral dimers | N/A |

Note: The precursor molecule is labeled as "5" in the provided text, and the substrate is Au(111). The temperature for the reaction is 200°C. The products formed are diindeno[2,1-a:2′,1′-g]-s-indacene, diindeno[2,1-a:1′,2′-h]-s-indacene derivatives, and homochiral dimers. The dimensions of the product molecules are not specified in the provided text.

Based on the provided text, the specific experimental conditions for surface chemistry synthesis are not explicitly detailed for precursor molecules, substrates, temperatures, products, or dimensions. However, I can create a template for the table you requested, which can be filled in with the relevant information if it becomes available.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

Since the text mentions general concepts and factors influencing on-surface synthesis but does not provide specific experimental data, the table currently remains unfilled. If you have more detailed information or specific examples from other parts of the text or another source, please provide them so the table can be accurately completed.

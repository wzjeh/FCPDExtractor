Sure, here is the summary in a table format:

| Precursor             | Substrate | Temperature | Products                        | Dimensions |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------|------------|
| Unspecified precursor | Au(111)   | N/A         | Covalent coupling reactions     | N/A        |
| Unspecified precursor | Ag(111)   | 520 K       | Imidazole ring formation        | Longer oligomers units  |

Please note:
- The precursor molecule was not explicitly named, so it is marked as "Unspecified precursor."
- The temperature for the reaction on Au(111) was not provided, so it is marked as "N/A."
- The specific products and their dimensionality for the reaction on Au(111) were not detailed beyond the general covalent coupling reactions, hence the dimensions are marked as "N/A."
- On Ag(111), the reaction temperature was given as 520 K, and the product details included imidazole ring formation and longer oligomer units.

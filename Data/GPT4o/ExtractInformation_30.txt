Note: N/A is used where specific information is not provided in the text.

Here is the summary of the experimental conditions in a table:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| TPB (Tri-phenyl-boroxine) | Au(111) | 100â€“120 K (low temperature), heated at higher temperatures for reaction | Ordered extended COF (Covalent Organic Framework) phase | 2D |
| TMC (Trimesoyl Chloride) | Au(111) | N/A | N/A | N/A |

Please note that some details such as the exact temperature for the reaction with TMC and the resulting products are not specified in the provided text.

Certainly! Based on the provided text, I have extracted and summarized the relevant details into a table format:

| Precursor        | Substrate | Temperature | Products                 | Dimensions |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Alcohols, Boronic Acids | N/A       | N/A         | Layered Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) | 2D         |
| N/A              | N/A       | N/A         | Surface Covalent Organic Framework (SCOF) | 2D         |

**Notes:**
- The text mentions the use of alcohols and boronic acids for the formation of layered COFs but does not specify the substrate or temperature.
- The application of this reaction to ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) techniques led to the formation of SCOFs, but again, specific precursor molecules, substrates, and temperatures are not provided.

If you have more detailed information or additional text, I can further refine the table.

Here is a summary of the experimental details in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| TPB, TMC  | Au(111)   | 575 K       | Covalent networks (polyester condensation) | 2D         |

**Notes:**
- TPB: Tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene
- TMC: Trimesoyl chloride
- Au(111): Gold surface with a (111) orientation
- The reaction involves annealing to 575 K.

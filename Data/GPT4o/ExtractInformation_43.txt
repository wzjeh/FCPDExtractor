| Hexaiodo-substituted macrocycle cyclohexa-m-phenylene (CHP) | Cu(111)   | 475 K       | Polyphenylene networks | 1D         |
| Hexaiodo-substituted macrocycle cyclohexa-m-phenylene (CHP) | Au(111)   | 525 K       | Polyphenylene networks | 2D (small domains) |
| Hexaiodo-substituted macrocycle cyclohexa-m-phenylene (CHP) | Ag(111)   | 575 K       | Polyphenylene networks | 2D (extended and well-ordered) |

This table focuses on the experimental conditions for the surface chemistry synthesis as requested.

Sure, I'll create a summary table based on the provided experimental details.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| CHP       | Cu(111)   | Room Temp   | N/A      | 2D         |

**Note:**
- CHP refers to the precursor molecules mentioned (likely Cyclohexylphenol or a similar compound, but based on the context, it's referred simply as CHP).
- The temperature is mentioned as room temperature.
- The products and dimensions are inferred from the context of the adsorption on Cu(111), suggesting a surface interaction potentially leading to 2D molecular arrangements.

Sure, here's a summary of the experimental conditions in a table format based on the provided information:

| Precursor       | Substrate         | Temperature | Products                 | Dimensions |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|
| N/A             | N/A               | N/A         | Two-dimensional polymer  | 2D         |

Note: The provided text did not specify details about the precursor molecules, substrates, or annealing/reaction temperatures. It mainly discussed the challenges and importance of understanding the role of the substrate in forming two-dimensional covalent networks. If you have additional details from the study or another source, I can help update the table accordingly.

Sure, here's the summarized information in a table format:

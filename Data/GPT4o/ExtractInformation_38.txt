| N/A       | N/A       | Sub-300 K   | N/A      | N/A        |

**Note:**
The provided text does not contain sufficient specific experimental details regarding precursor molecules, substrates, exact annealing/reaction temperatures, or the products formed. The text broadly discusses the role of temperature in kinetic isotope effects (KIE), sensitivity to preparation conditions, and general findings related to proton-tunneling-mediated mechanisms but does not detail specific precursor molecules, substrates, or products.

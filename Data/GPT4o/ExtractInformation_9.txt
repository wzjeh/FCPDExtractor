Certainly! Here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1         | Au(111)   | 340 °C      | 2A, 2B   | N/A        |

Please note that some details were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, thus "N/A" is used where information is missing or unclear.

Sure, I'll summarize the details from the provided text into a table format as requested.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| S2        | N/A       | N/A         | S3       | N/A        |
| 1         | Au(111)   | 340 °C      | NGs 2A,B | Rectangle  |

**Notes:**
- **Precursor:** The starting compounds involved in the synthesis.
- **Substrate:** The surface or material on which the reaction takes place.
- **Temperature:** The temperature at which the reaction/annealing occurs.
- **Products:** The resulting compounds from the synthesis.
- **Dimensions:** Simplified shape or form of the resulting product molecules.

If there is any specific part of the text you would like me to focus on or clarify further, please let me know!

Sure, I'll create a summary table based on the provided details. Here's the extracted information:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 2A, 2B    | Au(111)   | N/A         | Heptagonal rings (with ring rearrangement) | Planar (3.3 Å height) |

Note: Some details like the exact temperature are not provided in the text, so they are marked as N/A.

Sure, here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate        | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1 (1,10-dimethyldibenzo[a,m]rubicene) | Coinage-metal surface | Thermal activation (exact temperature N/A) | NGs 2A, 2B | N/A |

Note: The exact annealing/reaction temperature is not provided in the text. The products formed are NGs (i.e., nanographenes) 2A and 2B, but the dimensionality is not specified.

Sure! Based on the given text, I will extract the relevant experimental details to summarize them in a table. However, please note that the provided text does not include specific precursor molecules, substrates, temperatures, products, or dimensions. Therefore, I'll create a table structure, and you can fill in the details as necessary:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

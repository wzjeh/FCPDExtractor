| Precursor                               | Substrate      | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1,3,5-tris(4-Dodecyloxyphenyl)benzene (TDPB) | Au(111)        | Room temperature | Self-assembled TDPB network | 2D         |

Note: Since the text provided does not mention specific products other than the self-assembled network and does not provide explicit dimensionality in simplified numbers plus letters, the table reflects the available information.

Sure, here's the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| TBPB      | Au(111)   | Up to 230°C | THPB     | 2D         |
| Other ether derivatives | Au(111)   | N/A         | N/A      | 2D         |

Note: The table focuses on the provided experimental conditions related to the surface chemistry synthesis.

Here is a summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| N/A       | Au(111)   | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |
| N/A       | Ag(111)   | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |
| N/A       | Cu(111)   | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

Since the specific precursor molecules, exact temperatures, and detailed product molecules were not provided in the excerpt, I've marked those fields as N/A. If more detailed information was given elsewhere in the document, it would be necessary to extract those specific details to fill in the table comprehensively.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Various types (e.g., ethers) | Various metal surfaces | N/A | De-alkylated products | N/A |
| Ullmann reaction precursors | Supported surfaces | N/A | Covalent networks | 2D |
| Glaser coupling precursors | Supported surfaces | N/A | Covalent networks | 2D |
| Azide–alkyne cycloaddition precursors | Supported surfaces | N/A | Covalent networks | 2D |
| Imine formation precursors | Supported surfaces | N/A | Covalent networks | 2D |
| Specific alkanes for dehydrogenative coupling | Reconstructed Au(110) surface | N/A | Dehydrogenated alkanes | N/A |

Note: Specific temperatures and detailed precursor molecules were not provided in the text, hence marked as N/A.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 4,4′-dibromo-1,1′:3′,1″-terphenyl | Ag(111) single crystal | 640 K (annealing) | N/A | N/A |
| 4,4″-dibromo-1,1′:4′,1″:3″,1‴:4‴,1⁗-quinquephenyl | Ag(111) single crystal | 640 K (annealing) | N/A | N/A |

**Note:** The specific products and their dimensions were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so they are marked as N/A.

Sure, I can help with that. Here's the summary table based on the provided information:

| Precursor                           | Substrate         | Temperature | Products                                                             | Dimensions    |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 4,4''-dibromo-meta-quinquephenyl    | Ag(111) single-crystal surface | N/A         | [30]-honeycombene (C180H120), cycloicosaphenylene (C120H80), cyclopentacosaphenylene (C150H100), cyclopentatriacontaphenylene (C210H140) | N/A           |

Note: The temperature information was not provided in the text, so "N/A" is used for that column.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Small precursor molecules | Metal surface | N/A | Large oligophenylene macrocycles ([n]-honeycombenes) | N/A |

Note: The specific details about the precursor molecules, substrates, and reaction temperatures were not provided in the text excerpt. The information given focused on the general feasibility and application of solid-state synthesis on surfaces, particularly using C-C coupling reactions. If more detailed experimental conditions were mentioned elsewhere in the document, those would need to be referenced to complete the table accurately.

Sure, I'll extract the relevant experimental conditions and summarize them in a table for you.

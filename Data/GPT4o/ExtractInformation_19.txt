Here is a summary of the relevant details in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Enediyne 1 | Au(111) | N/A | 2 | 2D |
| Enediyne 1 | Au(111) | N/A | 4 | 2D |
| Enediyne 1 | Au(111) | N/A | 5 | 2D |
| Enediyne 1 | Au(111) | N/A | 6 | 2D |

- **Precursor**: The starting material used in the experiment, which is enediyne 1.
- **Substrate**: The surface on which the reaction takes place, which is Au(111).
- **Temperature**: Not specified in the provided text, so marked as N/A.
- **Products**: The compound molecules formed as a result of the reaction, named 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- **Dimensions**: The dimensionality of the product molecules, which are all 2D as inferred from the context and STM image descriptions.

If there are any additional details or specific aspects you need further explained, feel free to ask!

Certainly! Based on the provided information, I'll summarize the details in a table format as requested. Since some specific details like temperatures and dimensions are not provided in the excerpt, I will mark them as N/A.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Precursor 1 | Au(111) | N/A | Monomers and dimers with R, S, RR, and SS chirality | N/A |

Note: The provided text does not give specific details on the temperature or the exact dimensionality of the product molecules. For comprehensive information, please refer to the Supporting Information in the original article.

Sure, here is the summarized information in a table:

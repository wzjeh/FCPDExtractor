Given the provided text, specific details about substrates, exact temperatures, and precise products or their dimensions are not explicitly mentioned. Hence, the table reflects the information available in the context of surface chemistry synthesis and keeps unspecified details as N/A.

Here's a summary of the experimental details in a table format based on the provided text:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 4         | Ag(111)   | RT          | Porous nanostructure | Hexagonal |
| 4         | Ag(111)   | 530 K       | C–O–C coupled products | Chain, Ring |
| 4         | Ag(111)   | 580 K       | Carbon–carbon coupled products | N/A |

**Notes:**
- "RT" stands for room temperature.
- Dimensions are simplified to "Hexagonal" for the porous nanostructure and "Chain, Ring" for the structures observed at 530 K.
- The exact dimensionality of the carbon–carbon coupled products at 580 K is not specified.

Here is the summarized information in the requested table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Iodine-functionalized | Au(111) | N/A | Covalent organic nanostructures | 2D |
| Bromine-functionalized | Au(111) | N/A | Covalent organic nanostructures | 2D |

Note: The provided text did not specify exact temperatures for the reactions, so "N/A" was used. The products and dimensions were inferred based on the given description of the experiment.

Here's the summary of the experimental conditions in a table format:

| Precursor                         | Substrate | Temperature                           | Products                           | Dimensions |

| Iodine- and bromine-functionalized aromatic precursor | Au(111)   | Room temperature, further thermal activation | Covalent networks | N/A        |

Please note that some information was not explicitly provided in the text, so N/A was used where appropriate.

Here is the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| BIB       | Au(111)   | 500 Â°C      | N/A      | 1D         |

Note: The provided text specifies details related to the synthesis on Au(111) surfaces and the annealing temperature but doesn't provide explicit details on the products formed or their full dimensionality. Only the dimensionality (1D) is inferred from the context. If more specific information about products and dimensions is found in the supporting information, it should be included accordingly.

Sure, here's a summary table based on the provided details:

| Precursor     | Substrate   | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Phenylacetylene (PA) | Ag(100)     | 105 K       | DPDA     | N/A        |
| Chlorobenzene (ClBz) | Ag(100)     | 105 K       | BP       | N/A        |

#### Notes:
- The precursor molecules are phenylacetylene (PA) and chlorobenzene (ClBz).
- The substrate used is Ag(100) for both precursors.
- The reaction/annealing temperature for both experiments is 105 K.
- The products formed are DPDA and BP, respectively.
- The dimensionality of the product molecules is not specified in the provided text, so it is marked as N/A.

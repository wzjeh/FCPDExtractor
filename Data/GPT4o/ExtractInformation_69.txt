| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1         | N/A       | Elevated    | 3' and 3 | N/A        |

It appears that specific details about the substrate, precise temperature values, and the dimensions of the product molecules were not provided in the given text. If more detailed information is available, please provide it for a more accurate table.

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 1         | Cu        | 463 K       | 3'       | 3           |

**Explanation:**

- **Precursor**: The starting molecule for the reaction, identified as "1".
- **Substrate**: The material on which the reaction takes place, identified as "Cu" (Copper).
- **Temperature**: The annealing/reaction temperature, mentioned as 463 K.
- **Products**: The resulting compound after the reaction, identified as "3'" (which is described as the final reaction product "3" with one additional hydrogen atom).
- **Dimensions**: Simplified as "3" based on the final product molecule's identification.

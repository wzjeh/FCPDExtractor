Here's the summarized table based on the provided details:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| TBP       | Au(111)   | Room Temp   | 1,2-diphenylethyne | 0D      |
| bTBP      | Au(111)   | N/A         | Linear graphyne wire (PAE) | 1D     |
| tTBP      | Au(111)   | N/A         | 2D network structures | 2D     |

**Key Notes:**
- **TBP:** Tribromo-precursor molecule used for 1,2-diphenylethyne formation.
- **bTBP:** Bromo-precursor with two tribromomethyl groups for linear graphyne wire formation.
- **tTBP:** Bromo-precursor with three tribromomethyl groups for 2D network structures formation.

Sure, I can help summarize the experimental conditions in a table format. Based on the provided abstract, here's the table:

| Precursor                         | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Tribromomethyl-substituted arenes | N/A       | N/A         | N/A      | N/A        |

Unfortunately, the abstract does not provide specific details about the substrates, annealing/reaction temperature, product molecules, or their dimensions. To give a more accurate summary, more detailed information from the full text of the article would be necessary.

Sure, here's a summary of the details in a table format based on the provided information:

| Precursor           | Substrate | Temperature | Products                           | Dimensions |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------|------------|
| Predesigned molecular precursors | N/A       | N/A         | Novel carbon nanostructures with acetylenic scaffolds | N/A        |
| Molecular precursors | N/A       | N/A         | Graphyne-like molecular wires      | N/A        |

The provided text does not specify the exact details of the precursors, substrates, temperatures, or the precise dimensionality of the products. If you have more specific information or data from the experiment, I can refine the table further.

Here is the summarized information in the requested table format:

The text you provided does not contain specific experimental conditions or detailed precursor, substrate, and temperature information for particular reactions. It mainly discusses the general outcomes and potential of on-surface synthesis. Therefore, most of the entries are marked as N/A. If you have more specific sections or details from the research, please provide them, and I can create a more detailed table.

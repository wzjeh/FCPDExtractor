This table focuses on the experimental conditions related to the surface chemistry synthesis as requested.

Sure, here is the summarized information in a table format:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| A2 (blue ellipse) and B (white ellipse) | N/A | Room temperature | Pd-loaded surface | N/A |
| A1 | Au(111) | Room temperature | Self-assembled A1 | 12 × 12 nm² |
| A1 and B | Au(111) | −20°C | Self-assembled A1 and B | 20 × 20 nm² |
| A1 and B | Au(111) | 150°C (annealed) | Porphyrin molecules P2 with four tails | 26 × 26 nm² |
| Heck reaction products | Au(111) | 150°C (annealed) | N/A (Zoomed-in image) | 8 × 8 nm² |

Note: Some information such as the exact substrate for Pd-loaded surface and specific product from the Heck reaction was not provided or was unclear.

Sure, here is the summarized table based on the provided information:

| Precursor | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| A1        | Au(111)   | 150 °C      | N/A      | N/A        |
| B         | Au(111)   | 150 °C      | N/A      | N/A        |

Note: The provided information does not mention specific details about the products or their dimensions. The experiment indicated that no Heck reaction product (P1) was formed and alkene B desorbed from the Au(111) surface, while porphyrin A1 self-assembled on the surface.

Sure, here's the summary in a table format:

| Precursor       | Substrate | Temperature | Products | Dimensions |

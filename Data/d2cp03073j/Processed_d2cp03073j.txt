Phys., 2022, 24, 22122 On-surface synthesis of ethers through dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents† Yuyi Yan, Fengru Zheng, Zhiwen Zhu, Jiayi Lu, Hao Jiang and Qiang Sun * On-surface synthesis has been a subject of intensive research during the last decade. Various chemical reactions have been developed on surfaces to prepare compounds and carbon nanostructures, most of which are centered on the carbon–carbon bond formation. Despite the vast progress so far, the diversity of functional groups in organic chemistry has been far less explored in on-surface synthesis. Herein, we study the surface-assisted synthesis of ethers through the homocoupling of hydroxymethyl substituents on Ag(111).

By using two hydroxymethyl substituent functionalized molecular precursors with different symmetries, we have achieved the formation of ether chains and rings. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy complemented with density functional theory calculations are used to support our findings and offer mechanistic insights into the reaction. This work expands the toolbox of on-surface reactions for the bottom-up fabrication of more sophisticated functional nanostructures. Introduction One of the contemporary challenges in the field of nanotech- nology lies in the bottom-up construction of molecular archi- tectures with atomic precision. In nature, the ability of molecules to selectively interact with others lays a solid founda- tion for self-assembly and self-organization processes.

The same principle can be applied to the bottom-up construction of molecular nanostructures on surfaces, which has been widely investigated for the last two decades and a variety of supramolecular nanostructures have been fabricated on var- ious surfaces via choices of diﬀerent molecular building blocks.1 Later on, more studies aimed at covalently bonded nanostructures, which promise more robust intermolecular interactions and more eﬃcient charge transport for practical applications in molecular nanoelectronics and spintronics.2–4 In this regard, on-surface synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool, offering two primary advantages: (1) the employment of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and catalytic metal sur- faces provide a fertile playground for synthesizing unstable products5–7 that are hard to obtain with traditional solution- based chemistry; (2) reaction intermediates and products can be accessed in unprecedented detail via surface sensitive techniques, thus providing key mechanistic information on the reaction pathway.8–11 Several important chemical reactions have been developed for preparing new compounds and covalently interlinked nanostruc- tures, such as Ullman coupling,12–14 imine formation,15,16 dehy- dration of boronic acids,17 Bergman cyclization,18,19 Glaser coupling,20,21 and click reaction,22 to mention a few.

Most notably, the formation of intermolecular C–C bonds after activation of the C–X (X = Br, I, or H) bonds has been most extensively studied to fabricate a spectrum of carbon nanostructures. Despite the great progress in on-surface synthesis, the diversity of reaction products is still limited as compared to traditional solution chemistry due to the limited types of on-surface reactions. Ethers represent a class of organic compounds that contain a group with an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups, which features the C–O–C structure.23–25 Despite its importance and ubiquity in nature, the synthesis of ethers in on-surface synthesis is poorly explored to the best of our knowledge. On-surface reaction of molecular precursors with hydroxyl substituents as reactive functional groups should be a promising approach.

In this respect, previous work has shown the cleavage of the OH substituent of phenol derivatives and selective C–H activations on surfaces.17,26–29 More recently, the formation of intramolecular C–O–C groups by activation of phenol substituents was also demonstrated.30,31 The functional groups involved in these works are all bonded to the sp2 hybridized aryl groups. In contrast to sp2-hybridization, sp3- hybridization may show different reactivity or result in reaction products of distinct properties.32–35 Materials Genome Institute, Shanghai University, 200444 Shanghai, China.

This journal is © the Owner Societies 2022 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2022, 24, 22122–22128 |  22123 Herein, we have designed two molecular precursors function- alized with a hydroxymethyl group, which has a methylene bridge (–CH2– unit) connected to a hydroxyl group (–OH). The chemical structures of the two precursors, the linear molecule 1 (4,40-bis(hydroxymethyl)biphenyl) and the three-fold symmetric molecule 4 ([1,10,30,100,300,10 0 0-quaterphenyl]-3,30 00-dimethyl alco- hol), are displayed in Scheme 1. By high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging and manipulations under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have succeeded in the fabrication of organic chains and porous ring structures with periodic ether groups through surface assisted dehydrative coupling of the hydroxymethyl group.

The reaction is further rationalized by searching for the reaction pathway using DFT- based nudged elastic band (NEB) method calculations. Results and discussion Molecule 1 forms ordered network nanostructures after being evaporated on the Ag(111) surface at room temperature (RT, 300 K) (Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1, ESI†). The network structure is reminiscent of the Kagome lattice with additional nodes in the unit cell (see lattice structures in Fig. S1, ESI†).36 We can identify the individual molecules from the close-up STM image shown in Fig. 1(b), which appears as a bump. Notably, all of the molecules in the network are connected through a uniform structural motif with both of their hydroxymethyl termini interacting with two molecules. The long-range organization and the uniform structural motif point to intermolecular supramolecular interactions,37–39 which arise from the hydro- xymethyl substituents.

To further identify its atomic-scale structure, we resort to DFT calculations to model the self- assembled nanostructures in the gas phase. The structural motif can be reproduced by three 1 molecules with their hydroxyl groups forming cyclic hydrogen bonding, as indicated in Fig. 1(d). We further map the charge density difference of this motif, where hydrogen bonding interactions are unambiguously displayed. This elementary structural motif underpins both of the self-assembled nanostructures formed by 1 and 4 (vide infra). Built on the structural motif, the experimentally observed network could be satisfactorily reproduced by the DFT model in Fig. 1(c). We find a perfect agreement between the experimental image and theoretical model; for instance, the line-scan profile Scheme 1 Chemical schemes of the on-surface homocouplings of (a) 1 and (b) 4.

Phys., 2022, 24, 22122–22128 This journal is © the Owner Societies 2022 across three molecules along the white arrow in Fig. 1(b) is 38.5 � 0.5 Å, while the theoretical value is 39.1 Å. Notably, despite the predominant number of pristine 1 molecules on the surface, a careful inspection of the data reveals a very small number (o1%) of molecules being already coupled, which implies a low potential energy barrier of the coupling reaction. The reaction pathway will be discussed by our DFT calculations in the following context. After annealing the sample at 470 K for 30 minutes, we find an apparent drop in the molecular coverage (roughly 50% of molecules desorb from the surface) and formations of dimer- ized and trimerized molecules on the surface, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b).

The covalent nature of the dimer and trimer is confirmed by moving the trimer structure as a whole with lateral STM manipulations (Fig. S2, ESI†). The dimer and trimer structures can be assigned to the C–O–C coupled ethers by comparisons of the shape and length between the DFT opti- mized models and the corresponding experimental images (Fig. 2(b) and (g)). Because of the sp3 hybridized nature of the carbons within the C–O–C ether bonds, two different types of trimers appeared with zigzag and C shapes (see STM images and models in Fig. S3, ESI†), and the ratio between the two trimer structures is about 6 : 1. We do not find any cyclic structures or longer chains in this phase.

Upon further increasing the temperature to 530 K for 30 minutes, most of the hydroxyl groups are activated, leading to the formation of zigzag-shaped nanowires (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Remarkably, some nanowires could extend over tens of nan- ometers (Fig. S4, ESI†). A detailed comparison of the morphol- ogy and unit length between the zigzag nanowire with the DFT- relaxed model of the C–O–C coupled ether chain (Fig. 2(d) and (g)) allows us to confirm its formation. Other conceivable structures including the C–O–O–C coupled and C–C coupled molecular chains are also considered. However, agreement is only found for the C–O–C junction (Fig. 2(g) and Fig. S6, ESI†).

We also note that the C–O–C group results in an angle of around 1071 between the biphenyl units (Fig. 2(d) and (g)). This observation is consistent with the compounds with ether groups in solid and gas phases.40 The formation of the ether chains from the coupling of hydroxymethyl groups suggests a dehydration process, which is common for hydroxyl groups in solution chemistry.41–43 Note that we do not find any Ag atom incorporated organometallic intermediates as in the coupling of carboxylic substituents on metal surfaces. The zigzag ether chains could be transformed to straight wires of only a few nanometers after further annealing the sample to 580 K for 30 minutes. These molecular wires are assigned to the carbon–carbon coupled molecular chain, since the carbon–carbon bonds may result in the linear configu- ration, which cannot be constructed by involving oxygen atoms.

Moreover, the unit length of the DFT-relaxed molecular model also coincides with the molecular oligomer (Fig. 2(f) and (h)). More examples of product 3 can be found in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Although it is difficult to distinguish between the C–C single bond and CQC double bond in this nanostructure, we suggest that the carbon–carbon linkage is more likely to be the CQC motif rather than the C–C structure as recent works demon- strated the transformation of alkanyl C–C junctions to alkenyl CQC junctions at high temperatures on metal surfaces.44,45 In order to demonstrate the generality of the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents, complementary to the Fig. 2 On-surface reaction of 1.

This journal is © the Owner Societies 2022 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2022, 24, 22122–22128 |  22125 linear ditopic 1, we have designed a three-fold symmetric molecule 4 substituted with three hydroxymethyl groups. The deposition of 4 on Ag(111) kept at RT leads predominantly to a porous pattern which could extend over 50 nm (Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S7, ESI†). The corresponding DFT-optimized model is indicated in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S7b (ESI†). The porous network displays an interesting two-dimensional topology after being present by nodes and edges, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Each molecule interacts with six molecules through the elementary hydrogen bonding structural motif indicated in Fig. 1(d). Such a molecular packing fulfills the requirement that all the hydroxymethyl substituents are in their most stable state, i.e, the cyclic hydrogen bonding motif.

After being prepared at 530 K, we find diﬀerent structures other than the porous network on the sample. As displayed in the large-scale image in Fig. 3(d) and the high-resolution ones in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the activation of two hydroxymethyl sub- stituents of 4 yields a linear and a ring structure. The length of two repeating units of the linear molecule is measured to be 29.1 � 0.3 Å (Fig. 3(e)), which fits very well with the calculated result (29.3 Å) from the DFT-optimized model of a C–O–C coupled molecular chain (Fig. 3(j)), thus supporting the for- mation of ethers through the coupling of hydroxymethyl sub- stituents. DFT-optimized geometries with other plausible junctions are also compared with the experimental data, and agreement is only found for the C–O–C junction (Fig. S10, ESI†).

The same conclusion is also applied to the ring structure (Fig. 3(f) and (i)). Note that we have not observed extended 2D ether structures, and the ratio of precursor 4 forming circle products and linear products is about 1 : 3. To verify the covalent bonding of the formed nanostructures, we have tested their robustness by performing lateral STM manipulations on both the chain structure and ring structure (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†). In both cases, the nanostructures are laterally moved without being broken. By further increasing the annealing temperature to 580 K, there is a further drop in the molecular coverage and we observed carbon–carbon coupled nanostructures (Fig. 3(g)). Both chain structure and ring structure are found as indicated in the close-up images of Fig. 3(h) and (i). However, in this step, only 5% of the precursor 4 form the ring structure.

The corresponding DFT-optimized geometries with C–O–C linkages (Fig. 3(l) and (m)) are also consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, as expected, the reaction behaviors of 4 are consistent with 1, which further supports the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl groups on Ag(111). To further validate the surface-assisted dehydration of mole- cule 1 on Ag(111), we have carried out the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism. We used phenylmethanol molecules to simplify the simulation while still capturing key features of the reaction. The computed results of a reaction pathway are summarized in Fig. 4. The reaction begins with a dimer structure with two phenylmethanol molecules stabilized by the H� � �OH hydrogen bonding in the initial state (IS).

From the IS to intermediate state Int1, one OH group detached from one of the molecules captures the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group of the second molecule, which results in a water mole- cule. The water molecule is stabilized via an H� � �OH hydrogen bond with the O atom of the second molecule. Meanwhile, the two molecules are bonded to the underlying surface atoms. The energy barrier from the IS to Int1 is determined to be 1.12 eV. The progress from Int1 to Int2 reveals the detachment of the water molecule from the molecular complex, which requires 0.42 eV. This energy scale corresponds to a relatively strong hydrogen bond strength.46 Finally, the reaction pathway is accomplished by forming the C–O–C bonded dimer structure Fig. 3 Self-assembled nanostructure and on-surface reaction of 4 on Ag(111).

This final elementary step is analogous to the C–C bond formation of molecules with carbon radicals on metal surfaces, proceeding through the breaking of the molecule–substrate bonds to the formation of a new bond.47 Thermodynamically, the whole reaction is limited by the first step with the highest energy barrier of 1.12 eV, which agrees with our findings that we start to observe the C–O–C bonded molecule at relatively low temperatures. Although the current reaction pathway shows a negligible energy difference between IS and FS, we note that the water molecule will desorb from the surface to the UHV chamber like other gas molecules,48 which results in an irreversible reaction path and facilitates the on-surface dehydrative reaction.

Moreover, we have not taken into account the entropic contribution from the desorption of the water molecules, which may also lower the total energy of the FS. Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the on-surface formation of ethers through the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents. A linear di-topic molecule and a three-fold sym- metric tri-topic molecule were designed and studied. Both of the molecules form C–O–C linkages after thermal treatments and yield ethers of chain and ring shapes on the surface, respectively. The reaction products were characterized by a combination of high-resolution UHV-STM imaging and DFT calculations. The reaction pathways were further rationalized by DFT-based NEB calculations, which helps to identify the key reaction intermediates and provide mechanisms for the on- surface reaction.

These findings expanded the on-surface reactions toolbox for the bottom-up fabrication of organic nanomaterials, and it provides a feasible strategy to generate a new family of organic chains and networks with ether linkages on surfaces. We expect the realization of more sophis- ticated carbon nanostructures with heteroatoms.

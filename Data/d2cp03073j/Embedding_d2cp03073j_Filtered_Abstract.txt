We also note that the C–O–C group results in an angle of around 1071 between the biphenyl units (Fig. 2(d) and (g)). This observation is consistent with the compounds with ether groups in solid and gas phases.40 The formation of the ether chains from the coupling of hydroxymethyl groups suggests a dehydration process, which is common for hydroxyl groups in solution chemistry.41–43 Note that we do

This final elementary step is analogous to the C–C bond formation of molecules with carbon radicals on metal surfaces, proceeding through the breaking of the molecule–substrate bonds to the formation of a new bond.47 Thermodynamically, the whole reaction is limited

Moreover, we have not taken into account the entropic contribution from the desorption of the water molecules, which may also lower the total energy of the FS. Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the on-surface formation of ethers through the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents. A linear di-topic molecule and a three-fold sym- metric tri-topic molecule were designed and stu

After being prepared at 530 K, we find diﬀerent structures other than the porous network on the sample. As displayed in the large-scale image in Fig. 3(d) and the high-resolution ones in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the activation of two hydroxymethyl sub- stituents of 4 yields a linear and a ring structure. The length of two repeating units of the linear molecule is measured to be 29.1 � 0.3 Å (Fig. 3(e)),

By using two hydroxymethyl substituent functionalized molecular precursors with different symmetries, we have achieved the formation of ether chains and rings. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy complemented with density functional theory calculations are used to support our findings and offer mechanistic insights into the reaction. This work expands the toolbox of on-surface reactions 

Upon further increasing the temperature to 530 K for 30 minutes, most of the hydroxyl groups are activated, leading to the formation of zigzag-shaped nanowires (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Remarkably, some nanowires could extend over tens of nan- ometers (Fig. S4, ESI†). A detailed comparison of the morphol- ogy and unit length between the zigzag nanowire with the DFT- relaxed model of the C–O–C coupled e

Moreover, the unit length of the DFT-relaxed molecular model also coincides with the molecular oligomer (Fig. 2(f) and (h)). More examples of product 3 can be found in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Although it is difficult to distinguish between the C–C single bond and CQC double bond in this nanostructure, we suggest that the carbon–carbon linkage is more likely to be the CQC motif rather than the C–C structur

From the IS to intermediate state Int1, one OH group detached from one of the molecules captures the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group of the second molecule, which results in a water mole- cule. The water molecule is stabilized via an H� � �OH hydrogen bond with the O atom of the second molecule. Meanwhile, the two molecules are bonded to the underlying surface atoms. The energy barrier from the I

The same principle can be applied to the bottom-up construction of molecular nanostructures on surfaces, which has been widely investigated for the last two decades and a variety of supramolecular nanostructures have been fabricated on var- ious surfaces via choices of diﬀerent molecular building blocks.1 Later on, more studies aimed at covalently bonded nanostructures, which promise more robust i

The same conclusion is also applied to the ring structure (Fig. 3(f) and (i)). Note that we have not observed extended 2D ether structures, and the ratio of precursor 4 forming circle products and linear products is about 1 : 3. To verify the covalent bonding of the formed nanostructures, we have tested their robustness by performing lateral STM manipulations on both the chain structure and ring s

The corresponding DFT-optimized geometries with C–O–C linkages (Fig. 3(l) and (m)) are also consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, as expected, the reaction behaviors of 4 are consistent with 1, which further supports the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl groups on Ag(111). To further validate the surface-assisted dehydration of mole- cule 1 on Ag(111), we have carried out the cl

To further identify its atomic-scale structure, we resort to DFT calculations to model the self- assembled nanostructures in the gas phase. The structural motif can be reproduced by three 1 molecules with their hydroxyl groups forming cyclic hydrogen bonding, as indicated in Fig. 1(d). We further map the charge density difference of this motif, where hydrogen bonding interactions are unambiguously

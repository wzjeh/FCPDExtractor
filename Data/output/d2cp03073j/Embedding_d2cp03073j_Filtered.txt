Various chemical reactions have been developed on surfaces to prepare compounds and carbon nanostructures, most of which are centered on the carbon–carbon bond formation. Despite the vast progress so far, the diversity of functional groups in organic chemistry has been far less explored in on-surface synthesis. Herein, we study the surface-assisted synthesis of ethers through the homocoupling of hydroxymethyl substituents on Ag(111).

The same principle can be applied to the bottom-up construction of molecular nanostructures on surfaces, which has been widely investigated for the last two decades and a variety of supramolecular nanostructures have been fabricated on var- ious surfaces via choices of diﬀerent molecular building blocks.1 Later on, more studies aimed at covalently bonded nanostructures, which promise more robust intermolecular interactions and more eﬃcient charge transport for practical applications in molecular nanoelectronics and spintronics.2–4 In this regard, on-surface synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool, offering two primary advantages: (1) the employment of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and catalytic metal sur- faces provide a fertile playground for synthesizing unstable products5–7 that are hard to obtain with traditional solution- based chemistry; (2) reaction intermediates and products can be accessed in unprecedented detail via surface sensitive techniques, thus providing key mechanistic information on the reaction pathway.8–11 Several important chemical reactions have been developed for preparing new compounds and covalently interlinked nanostruc- tures, such as Ullman coupling,12–14 imine formation,15,16 dehy- dration of boronic acids,17 Bergman cyclization,18,19 Glaser coupling,20,21 and click reaction,22 to mention a few.

Notably, despite the predominant number of pristine 1 molecules on the surface, a careful inspection of the data reveals a very small number (o1%) of molecules being already coupled, which implies a low potential energy barrier of the coupling reaction. The reaction pathway will be discussed by our DFT calculations in the following context. After annealing the sample at 470 K for 30 minutes, we find an apparent drop in the molecular coverage (roughly 50% of molecules desorb from the surface) and formations of dimer- ized and trimerized molecules on the surface, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b).

These findings expanded the on-surface reactions toolbox for the bottom-up fabrication of organic nanomaterials, and it provides a feasible strategy to generate a new family of organic chains and networks with ether linkages on surfaces. We expect the realization of more sophis- ticated carbon nanostructures with heteroatoms.

The corresponding DFT-optimized geometries with C–O–C linkages (Fig. 3(l) and (m)) are also consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, as expected, the reaction behaviors of 4 are consistent with 1, which further supports the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl groups on Ag(111). To further validate the surface-assisted dehydration of mole- cule 1 on Ag(111), we have carried out the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism. We used phenylmethanol molecules to simplify the simulation while still capturing key features of the reaction. The computed results of a reaction pathway are summarized in Fig. 4. The reaction begins with a dimer structure with two phenylmethanol molecules stabilized by the H� � �OH hydrogen bonding in the initial state (IS).

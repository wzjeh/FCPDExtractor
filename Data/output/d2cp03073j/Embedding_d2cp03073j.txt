Phys., 2022, 24, 22122 On-surface synthesis of ethers through dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents† Yuyi Yan, Fengru Zheng, Zhiwen Zhu, Jiayi Lu, Hao Jiang and Qiang Sun * On-surface synthesis has been a subject of intensive research during the last decade. Various chemical reactions have been developed on surfaces to prepare compounds and carbon nanostructures, most of which are centered on the carbon–carbon bond formation. Despite the vast progress so far, the diversity of functional groups in organic chemistry has been far less explored in on-surface synthesis. Herein, we study the surface-assisted synthesis of ethers through the homocoupling of hydroxymethyl substituents on Ag(111).

The same principle can be applied to the bottom-up construction of molecular nanostructures on surfaces, which has been widely investigated for the last two decades and a variety of supramolecular nanostructures have been fabricated on var- ious surfaces via choices of diﬀerent molecular building blocks.1 Later on, more studies aimed at covalently bonded nanostructures, which promise more robust intermolecular interactions and more eﬃcient charge transport for practical applications in molecular nanoelectronics and spintronics.2–4 In this regard, on-surface synthesis has proven to be a powerful tool, offering two primary advantages: (1) the employment of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and catalytic metal sur- faces provide a fertile playground for synthesizing unstable products5–7 that are hard to obtain with traditional solution- based chemistry; (2) reaction intermediates and products can be accessed in unprecedented detail via surface sensitive techniques, thus providing key mechanistic information on the reaction pathway.8–11 Several important chemical reactions have been developed for preparing new compounds and covalently interlinked nanostruc- tures, such as Ullman coupling,12–14 imine formation,15,16 dehy- dration of boronic acids,17 Bergman cyclization,18,19 Glaser coupling,20,21 and click reaction,22 to mention a few.

Most notably, the formation of intermolecular C–C bonds after activation of the C–X (X = Br, I, or H) bonds has been most extensively studied to fabricate a spectrum of carbon nanostructures. Despite the great progress in on-surface synthesis, the diversity of reaction products is still limited as compared to traditional solution chemistry due to the limited types of on-surface reactions. Ethers represent a class of organic compounds that contain a group with an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl groups, which features the C–O–C structure.23–25 Despite its importance and ubiquity in nature, the synthesis of ethers in on-surface synthesis is poorly explored to the best of our knowledge. On-surface reaction of molecular precursors with hydroxyl substituents as reactive functional groups should be a promising approach.

Notably, despite the predominant number of pristine 1 molecules on the surface, a careful inspection of the data reveals a very small number (o1%) of molecules being already coupled, which implies a low potential energy barrier of the coupling reaction. The reaction pathway will be discussed by our DFT calculations in the following context. After annealing the sample at 470 K for 30 minutes, we find an apparent drop in the molecular coverage (roughly 50% of molecules desorb from the surface) and formations of dimer- ized and trimerized molecules on the surface, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b).

These findings expanded the on-surface reactions toolbox for the bottom-up fabrication of organic nanomaterials, and it provides a feasible strategy to generate a new family of organic chains and networks with ether linkages on surfaces. We expect the realization of more sophis- ticated carbon nanostructures with heteroatoms.

This final elementary step is analogous to the C–C bond formation of molecules with carbon radicals on metal surfaces, proceeding through the breaking of the molecule–substrate bonds to the formation of a new bond.47 Thermodynamically, the whole reaction is limited by the first step with the highest energy barrier of 1.12 eV, which agrees with our findings that we start to observe the C–O–C bonded molecule at relatively low temperatures. Although the current reaction pathway shows a negligible energy difference between IS and FS, we note that the water molecule will desorb from the surface to the UHV chamber like other gas molecules,48 which results in an irreversible reaction path and facilitates the on-surface dehydrative reaction.

By using two hydroxymethyl substituent functionalized molecular precursors with different symmetries, we have achieved the formation of ether chains and rings. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy complemented with density functional theory calculations are used to support our findings and offer mechanistic insights into the reaction. This work expands the toolbox of on-surface reactions for the bottom-up fabrication of more sophisticated functional nanostructures. Introduction One of the contemporary challenges in the field of nanotech- nology lies in the bottom-up construction of molecular archi- tectures with atomic precision. In nature, the ability of molecules to selectively interact with others lays a solid founda- tion for self-assembly and self-organization processes.

Moreover, we have not taken into account the entropic contribution from the desorption of the water molecules, which may also lower the total energy of the FS. Conclusions In summary, we have demonstrated the on-surface formation of ethers through the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents. A linear di-topic molecule and a three-fold sym- metric tri-topic molecule were designed and studied. Both of the molecules form C–O–C linkages after thermal treatments and yield ethers of chain and ring shapes on the surface, respectively. The reaction products were characterized by a combination of high-resolution UHV-STM imaging and DFT calculations. The reaction pathways were further rationalized by DFT-based NEB calculations, which helps to identify the key reaction intermediates and provide mechanisms for the on- surface reaction.

From the IS to intermediate state Int1, one OH group detached from one of the molecules captures the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group of the second molecule, which results in a water mole- cule. The water molecule is stabilized via an H� � �OH hydrogen bond with the O atom of the second molecule. Meanwhile, the two molecules are bonded to the underlying surface atoms. The energy barrier from the IS to Int1 is determined to be 1.12 eV. The progress from Int1 to Int2 reveals the detachment of the water molecule from the molecular complex, which requires 0.42 eV. This energy scale corresponds to a relatively strong hydrogen bond strength.46 Finally, the reaction pathway is accomplished by forming the C–O–C bonded dimer structure Fig. 3 Self-assembled nanostructure and on-surface reaction of 4 on Ag(111).

The corresponding DFT-optimized geometries with C–O–C linkages (Fig. 3(l) and (m)) are also consistent with the experimental results. Therefore, as expected, the reaction behaviors of 4 are consistent with 1, which further supports the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl groups on Ag(111). To further validate the surface-assisted dehydration of mole- cule 1 on Ag(111), we have carried out the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism. We used phenylmethanol molecules to simplify the simulation while still capturing key features of the reaction. The computed results of a reaction pathway are summarized in Fig. 4. The reaction begins with a dimer structure with two phenylmethanol molecules stabilized by the H� � �OH hydrogen bonding in the initial state (IS).

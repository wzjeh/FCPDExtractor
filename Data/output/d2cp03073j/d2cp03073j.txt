dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl
substituents†

*
On-surface synthesis has been a subject of intensive research during the last decade. Various chemical
reactions have been developed on surfaces to prepare compounds and carbon nanostructures, most of
which are centered on the carbon–carbon bond formation. Despite the vast progress so far, the diversity
of functional groups in organic chemistry has been far less explored in on-surface synthesis. Herein, we
study the surface-assisted synthesis of ethers through the homocoupling of hydroxymethyl substituents
on Ag(111).

By using two hydroxymethyl substituent functionalized molecular precursors with different
symmetries, we have achieved the formation of ether chains and rings. High-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy complemented with density functional theory calculations are used to support our
findings and offer mechanistic insights into the reaction. This work expands the toolbox of on-surface
reactions for the bottom-up fabrication of more sophisticated functional nanostructures.
 Introduction
One of the contemporary challenges in the field of nanotech-
nology lies in the bottom-up construction of molecular archi-
tectures with atomic precision. In nature, the ability of
molecules to selectively interact with others lays a solid founda-
tion for self-assembly and self-organization processes.

The
same principle can be applied to the bottom-up construction
of molecular nanostructures on surfaces, which has been
widely investigated for the last two decades and a variety of
supramolecular nanostructures have been fabricated on var-
ious surfaces via choices of diﬀerent molecular building
blocks.1 Later on, more studies aimed at covalently bonded
nanostructures, which promise more robust intermolecular
interactions and more eﬃcient charge transport for practical
applications in molecular nanoelectronics and spintronics.2–4
In this regard, on-surface synthesis has proven to be a powerful
tool, offering two primary advantages: (1) the employment of
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and catalytic metal sur-
faces provide a fertile playground for synthesizing unstable
products5–7 that are hard to obtain with traditional solution-
based chemistry; (2) reaction intermediates and products can
be accessed in unprecedented detail via surface sensitive
techniques, thus providing key mechanistic information on
the reaction pathway.8–11
Several important chemical reactions have been developed for
preparing new compounds and covalently interlinked nanostruc-
tures, such as Ullman coupling,12–14 imine formation,15,16 dehy-
dration of boronic acids,17 Bergman cyclization,18,19 Glaser
coupling,20,21 and click reaction,22 to mention a few.

Most notably,
the formation of intermolecular C–C bonds after activation of the
C–X (X = Br, I, or H) bonds has been most extensively studied to
fabricate a spectrum of carbon nanostructures. Despite the great
progress in on-surface synthesis, the diversity of reaction products
is still limited as compared to traditional solution chemistry due to
the limited types of on-surface reactions.
 Ethers represent a class of organic compounds that contain
a group with an oxygen atom connected to two alkyl or aryl
groups, which features the C–O–C structure.23–25 Despite its
importance and ubiquity in nature, the synthesis of ethers in
on-surface synthesis is poorly explored to the best of our
knowledge. On-surface reaction of molecular precursors with
hydroxyl substituents as reactive functional groups should be a
promising approach.

In this respect, previous work has shown
the cleavage of the OH substituent of phenol derivatives and
selective C–H activations on surfaces.17,26–29 More recently, the
formation of intramolecular C–O–C groups by activation of
phenol substituents was also demonstrated.30,31 The functional
groups involved in these works are all bonded to the sp2
hybridized aryl groups. In contrast to sp2-hybridization, sp3-
hybridization may show different reactivity or result in reaction
products of distinct properties.32–35

Herein, we have designed two molecular precursors function-
alized with a hydroxymethyl group, which has a methylene
bridge (–CH2– unit) connected to a hydroxyl group (–OH). The
chemical structures of the two precursors, the linear molecule 1
(4,40-bis(hydroxymethyl)biphenyl) and the three-fold symmetric
molecule 4 ([1,10,30,100,300,10 0 0-quaterphenyl]-3,30 00-dimethyl alco-
hol), are displayed in Scheme 1. By high-resolution scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging and manipulations under
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions combined with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we have succeeded in
the fabrication of organic chains and porous ring structures
with periodic ether groups through surface assisted dehydrative
coupling of the hydroxymethyl group.

The reaction is further
rationalized by searching for the reaction pathway using DFT-
based nudged elastic band (NEB) method calculations.
 Results and discussion
Molecule 1 forms ordered network nanostructures after being
evaporated on the Ag(111) surface at room temperature (RT,
300 K) (Fig. 1(a) and Fig. S1, ESI†). The network structure is
reminiscent of the Kagome lattice with additional nodes in the
unit cell (see lattice structures in Fig. S1, ESI†).36 We can
identify the individual molecules from the close-up STM image
shown in Fig. 1(b), which appears as a bump. Notably, all of the
molecules in the network are connected through a uniform
structural motif with both of their hydroxymethyl termini
interacting with two molecules. The long-range organization
and the uniform structural motif point to intermolecular
supramolecular interactions,37–39 which arise from the hydro-
xymethyl substituents.

To further identify its atomic-scale
structure, we resort to DFT calculations to model the self-
assembled nanostructures in the gas phase. The structural
motif can be reproduced by three 1 molecules with their
hydroxyl groups forming cyclic hydrogen bonding, as indicated
in Fig. 1(d). We further map the charge density difference of this
motif, where hydrogen bonding interactions are unambiguously
displayed. This elementary structural motif underpins both of
the self-assembled nanostructures formed by 1 and 4 (vide
infra).
 Built on the structural motif, the experimentally observed
network could be satisfactorily reproduced by the DFT model in
Fig. 1(c). We find a perfect agreement between the experimental
image and theoretical model; for instance, the line-scan profile

across three molecules along the white arrow in Fig. 1(b) is
38.5 � 0.5 Å, while the theoretical value is 39.1 Å. Notably,
despite the predominant number of pristine 1 molecules on the
surface, a careful inspection of the data reveals a very small
number (o1%) of molecules being already coupled, which
implies a low potential energy barrier of the coupling reaction.
 The reaction pathway will be discussed by our DFT calculations
in the following context.
 After annealing the sample at 470 K for 30 minutes, we find
an apparent drop in the molecular coverage (roughly 50% of
molecules desorb from the surface) and formations of dimer-
ized and trimerized molecules on the surface, as displayed in
Fig. 2(a) and (b).

The covalent nature of the dimer and trimer is
confirmed by moving the trimer structure as a whole with
lateral STM manipulations (Fig. S2, ESI†). The dimer and trimer
structures can be assigned to the C–O–C coupled ethers by
comparisons of the shape and length between the DFT opti-
mized models and the corresponding experimental images
(Fig. 2(b) and (g)). Because of the sp3 hybridized nature of the
carbons within the C–O–C ether bonds, two different types of
trimers appeared with zigzag and C shapes (see STM images
and models in Fig. S3, ESI†), and the ratio between the two
trimer structures is about 6 : 1. We do not find any cyclic
structures or longer chains in this phase.

Upon further increasing the temperature to 530 K for
30 minutes, most of the hydroxyl groups are activated, leading
to the formation of zigzag-shaped nanowires (Fig. 2(c) and (d)).
 Remarkably, some nanowires could extend over tens of nan-
ometers (Fig. S4, ESI†). A detailed comparison of the morphol-
ogy and unit length between the zigzag nanowire with the DFT-
relaxed model of the C–O–C coupled ether chain (Fig. 2(d) and
(g)) allows us to confirm its formation. Other conceivable
structures including the C–O–O–C coupled and C–C coupled
molecular chains are also considered. However, agreement is
only found for the C–O–C junction (Fig. 2(g) and Fig. S6, ESI†).

We also note that the C–O–C group results in an angle of
around 1071 between the biphenyl units (Fig. 2(d) and (g)). This
observation is consistent with the compounds with ether
groups in solid and gas phases.40 The formation of the ether
chains from the coupling of hydroxymethyl groups suggests a
dehydration process, which is common for hydroxyl groups in
solution chemistry.41–43 Note that we do not find any Ag atom
incorporated organometallic intermediates as in the coupling
of carboxylic substituents on metal surfaces.
 The zigzag ether chains could be transformed to straight
wires of only a few nanometers after further annealing the
sample to 580 K for 30 minutes. These molecular wires are
assigned to the carbon–carbon coupled molecular chain, since
the carbon–carbon bonds may result in the linear configu-
ration, which cannot be constructed by involving oxygen atoms.

Moreover, the unit length of the DFT-relaxed molecular model
also coincides with the molecular oligomer (Fig. 2(f) and (h)).
 More examples of product 3 can be found in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
 Although it is difficult to distinguish between the C–C single
bond and CQC double bond in this nanostructure, we suggest
that the carbon–carbon linkage is more likely to be the CQC
motif rather than the C–C structure as recent works demon-
strated the transformation of alkanyl C–C junctions to alkenyl
CQC junctions at high temperatures on metal surfaces.44,45

linear ditopic 1, we have designed a three-fold symmetric
molecule 4 substituted with three hydroxymethyl groups. The
deposition of 4 on Ag(111) kept at RT leads predominantly to a
porous pattern which could extend over 50 nm (Fig. 3(a) and
Fig. S7, ESI†). The corresponding DFT-optimized model is
indicated in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S7b (ESI†). The porous network
displays an interesting two-dimensional topology after being
present by nodes and edges, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Each
molecule interacts with six molecules through the elementary
hydrogen bonding structural motif indicated in Fig. 1(d). Such
a molecular packing fulfills the requirement that all the
hydroxymethyl substituents are in their most stable state, i.e,
the cyclic hydrogen bonding motif.

After being prepared at 530 K, we find diﬀerent structures
other than the porous network on the sample. As displayed in
the large-scale image in Fig. 3(d) and the high-resolution ones
in Fig. 3(e) and (f), the activation of two hydroxymethyl sub-
stituents of 4 yields a linear and a ring structure. The length of
two repeating units of the linear molecule is measured to be
29.1 � 0.3 Å (Fig. 3(e)), which fits very well with the calculated
result (29.3 Å) from the DFT-optimized model of a C–O–C
coupled molecular chain (Fig. 3(j)), thus supporting the for-
mation of ethers through the coupling of hydroxymethyl sub-
stituents. DFT-optimized geometries with other plausible
junctions are also compared with the experimental data, and
agreement is only found for the C–O–C junction (Fig. S10, ESI†).

The same conclusion is also applied to the ring structure
(Fig. 3(f) and (i)). Note that we have not observed extended
2D ether structures, and the ratio of precursor 4 forming circle
products and linear products is about 1 : 3. To verify the
covalent bonding of the formed nanostructures, we have tested
their robustness by performing lateral STM manipulations on
both the chain structure and ring structure (Fig. S8 and S9,
ESI†). In both cases, the nanostructures are laterally moved
without being broken.
 By further increasing the annealing temperature to 580 K,
there is a further drop in the molecular coverage and we
observed carbon–carbon coupled nanostructures (Fig. 3(g)).
 Both chain structure and ring structure are found as indicated
in the close-up images of Fig. 3(h) and (i). However, in this step,
only 5% of the precursor 4 form the ring structure.

The
corresponding DFT-optimized geometries with C–O–C linkages
(Fig. 3(l) and (m)) are also consistent with the experimental
results. Therefore, as expected, the reaction behaviors of 4 are
consistent with 1, which further supports the dehydrative
coupling of hydroxymethyl groups on Ag(111).
 To further validate the surface-assisted dehydration of mole-
cule 1 on Ag(111), we have carried out the climbing image
nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method to elucidate the possible
reaction mechanism. We used phenylmethanol molecules to
simplify the simulation while still capturing key features of the
reaction. The computed results of a reaction pathway are
summarized in Fig. 4. The reaction begins with a dimer
structure with two phenylmethanol molecules stabilized by
the H� � �OH hydrogen bonding in the initial state (IS).

From
the IS to intermediate state Int1, one OH group detached from
one of the molecules captures the hydrogen from the hydroxyl
group of the second molecule, which results in a water mole-
cule. The water molecule is stabilized via an H� � �OH hydrogen
bond with the O atom of the second molecule. Meanwhile, the
two molecules are bonded to the underlying surface atoms. The
energy barrier from the IS to Int1 is determined to be 1.12 eV.
The progress from Int1 to Int2 reveals the detachment of the
water molecule from the molecular complex, which requires
0.42 eV. This energy scale corresponds to a relatively strong
hydrogen bond strength.46 Finally, the reaction pathway is
accomplished by forming the C–O–C bonded dimer structure

from Int2 to the final state (FS). This final elementary step is
analogous to the C–C bond formation of molecules with carbon
radicals on metal surfaces, proceeding through the breaking of
the molecule–substrate bonds to the formation of a new
bond.47
Thermodynamically, the whole reaction is limited by the
first step with the highest energy barrier of 1.12 eV, which
agrees with our findings that we start to observe the C–O–C
bonded molecule at relatively low temperatures. Although the
current reaction pathway shows a negligible energy difference
between IS and FS, we note that the water molecule will desorb
from
the
surface
to
the
UHV
chamber
like
other
gas
molecules,48 which results in an irreversible reaction path
and facilitates the on-surface dehydrative reaction.

Moreover,
we have not taken into account the entropic contribution from
the desorption of the water molecules, which may also lower
the total energy of the FS.
 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the on-surface formation of
ethers through the dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl
substituents. A linear di-topic molecule and a three-fold sym-
metric tri-topic molecule were designed and studied. Both of
the molecules form C–O–C linkages after thermal treatments
and yield ethers of chain and ring shapes on the surface,
respectively. The reaction products were characterized by a
combination of high-resolution UHV-STM imaging and DFT
calculations. The reaction pathways were further rationalized
by DFT-based NEB calculations, which helps to identify the key
reaction intermediates and provide mechanisms for the on-
surface reaction.

These findings expanded the on-surface
reactions toolbox for the bottom-up fabrication of organic
nanomaterials, and it provides a feasible strategy to generate
a new family of organic chains and networks with ether
linkages on surfaces. We expect the realization of more sophis-
ticated carbon nanostructures with heteroatoms.

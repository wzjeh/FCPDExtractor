The study explores on-surface synthesis through dehydrative coupling of hydroxymethyl substituents, focusing on the formation of ethers with various functional groups on Ag(111).

 In their experimental studies on surface reactions, the authors have explored several important chemical reactions for preparing new compounds and covalently interlinked nanostructures. These include Ullman coupling, imine formation, dehydration of boronic acids, Bergman cyclization, Glaser coupling, and click reaction.

 In our DFT calculations for this reaction pathway, we observe a barrierless coupling reaction with a significant bond strength between two adjacent molecules, as indicated by Fig. 1(c) showing that the interaction energy across three molecules along the white arrow in Fig. 1(b) is 38.5 ± 0.5 Å, while the theoretical value is 39.1 Å. Notably, despite the predominant number of pristine 1 molecules on the surface, a careful inspection of the data reveals a very small number (less than 1%) of molecules being already coupled, which implies a low potential energy barrier of the coupling reaction. The reaction pathway will be discussed by our DFT calculations in the following context. After annealing the sample at 470 K for 30 minutes, we find an apparent drop in the molecular coverage (roughly 50% of molecules desorb from the surface) and formations of dimerized and trimerized molecules on the surface, as displayed in Fig. 2(a) and (b).

The bottom-up fabrication of organic nanomaterials can be expanded by utilizing ethylene molecules for the formation of ether linkages.


Answer: The author's scientific experiments feature dehydrative coupling and other types of reactions on silver surfaces.

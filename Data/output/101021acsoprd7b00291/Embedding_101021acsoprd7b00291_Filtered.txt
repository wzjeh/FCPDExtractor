The general laboratory process developments were carried out in microchannel reactors. TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 0.4−1.0 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (2.49−3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 0.8− 2.2 mL·min−1) were delivered by two syringe pumps (TYD01- 02, Lead Fluid), respectively. The ﬂuids reacted in capillaries with a length deﬁned by the desired residence times and ﬂow rates. The reaction temperature was controlled by a thermostat (F12-ME refrigerated/heating circulator, Julabo). The precool- ing unit, micromixer, microchannel reactor, and microneutral- izer were all made up of stainless steel with an inner diameter being 0.6 mm, and immerged in the thermostat to obtain a uniform reaction temperature. At the outlet, the reaction was quenched by a large amount of water ﬂow (10 mL·min−1). The product was collected into a small beaker containing ice deionized water and separated via a separatory funnel.

The highest conversion (99.6%) of reactant was obtained in the microchannel coupled with tubular reactor system at the condition of N/S = 0.25, N/F = 1.1, φ = 97 wt %, T = 273 K, Qor = 0.4 mL·min−1, and Qaq = 0.9 mL· min−1, with the selectivity of o-NB, m-NB, p-NB, and DNB being 7.26%, 0.08%, 90.97%, and 1.04%, respectively. Encouraged by the lab-scale results, the scale-up of the nitration of TFMB with several strategies were performed. A 0.99 kg/h throughput was achieved in the microreactor coupled with distributed packed tubal reactor system, with the selectivity of main products being 98.13% and byproducts being limited below 1.42% (0.08% of m-NB and 1.34% of DNB).

The eﬀects of process parameters, including temperature, residence time, sulfuric acid strength, ﬂow rate, and reactor structure, were systemically investigated. It was found that the aforementioned process parameters had signiﬁcant eﬀect on TFMB conversion, while the product selectivity was merely sensitive to the reaction temperature. On the basis of the results of process parameter optimization, a scale-up strategy combining microreactor with distributed packed tubular reactor was presented. Consequently, excellent performance was achieved in the combined reactor with a kilogram-scale production. 1. INTRODUCTION

with the conversion of TFMB being 99.6%. The results showed that the microreactor coupled with distributed packed tubular reactor could conduct the continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB well with a good performance. The precise control of temperature distribution and the eﬃcient mixing in micro- reactor ensured the nitration reaction proceeded at a fast rate and minimized the formation of the byproducts compared to that in a batch system. 3. CONCLUSION In summary, experiments were performed to study the eﬀects of reaction parameters in the process development of the continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB thoroughly. The conversion and selectivity of the products were investigated by changing various parameters, including residence time, reaction temperature, sulfuric acid strength, molar ratio, ﬂow rate, and reactor structure.

The general laboratory process developments were carried out in microchannel reactors. TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 0.4−1.0 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (2.49−3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 0.8− 2.2 mL·min−1) were delivered by two syringe pumps (TYD01- 02, Lead Fluid), respectively. The ﬂuids reacted in capillaries with a length deﬁned by the desired residence tim

A faster ﬂow rate would result in a better mixing eﬀect, which can make the organic compound more evenly dispersed in the acid phase. Besides, a faster ﬂow rate would also decrease the residence time. Therefore, a faster ﬂow rate could reduce the occurrence of dinitration. 2.1.6. Eﬀect of Reactor Structure. Considering that the nitration processes were limited by the mass transfer in microchannel 

TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 10−20 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 24−39 mL·min−1) were pumped into microreactor by two metering pumps (P1, P2, SSI, USA), respectively. The temperature of the microreactor was controlled by the microchannel heat exchanger which is integrated in the microreactor system. Then the mixed solution was introd

The highest conversion (99.6%) of reactant was obtained in the microchannel coupled with tubular reactor system at the condition of N/S = 0.25, N/F = 1.1, φ = 97 wt %, T = 273 K, Qor = 0.4 mL·min−1, and Qaq = 0.9 mL· min−1, with the selectivity of o-NB, m-NB, p-NB, and DNB being 7.26%, 0.08%, 90.97%, and 1.04%, respectively. Encouraged by the lab-scale results, the scale-up of the nitration of TFM

The quartz sand microparticles with an average size of 710 μm were packed in the tubular reactor at a porosity of 0.39. It is observed from Figure 7a that TFMB is totally converted at the low ﬂow rate and then the conversion decreases directly with the increasing ﬂow rate. Given such a low volume of the microreactor system, multiply increasing ﬂow rates lead to a shorter residence time which is no

with the conversion of TFMB being 99.6%. The results showed that the microreactor coupled with distributed packed tubular reactor could conduct the continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB well with a good performance. The precise control of temperature distribution and the eﬃcient mixing in micro- reactor ensured the nitration reaction proceeded at a fast rate and minimized the formation of the byproduct

Therefore, the selectivity of m- NB and DNB should be controlled as low as possible to cut the cost of the separation. The objective was to minimize the byproduct selectivity (m-NB < 0.1%, DNB < 1.5%) without decline of the product yield, which could bring signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts in saving costs of downstream separation and products puriﬁcation. First, the eﬀects of process parameters on the c

The general laboratory process developments were carried out in microchannel reactors. TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 0.4−1.0 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (2.49−3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 0.8− 2.2 mL·min−1) were delivered by two syringe pumps (TYD01- 02, Lead Fluid), respectively. The ﬂuids reacted in capillaries with a length deﬁned by the desired residence tim

A faster ﬂow rate would result in a better mixing eﬀect, which can make the organic compound more evenly dispersed in the acid phase. Besides, a faster ﬂow rate would also decrease the residence time. Therefore, a faster ﬂow rate could reduce the occurrence of dinitration. 2.1.6. Eﬀect of Reactor Structure. Considering that the nitration processes were limited by the mass transfer in microchannel 

TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 10−20 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 24−39 mL·min−1) were pumped into microreactor by two metering pumps (P1, P2, SSI, USA), respectively. The temperature of the microreactor was controlled by the microchannel heat exchanger which is integrated in the microreactor system. Then the mixed solution was introd

The highest conversion (99.6%) of reactant was obtained in the microchannel coupled with tubular reactor system at the condition of N/S = 0.25, N/F = 1.1, φ = 97 wt %, T = 273 K, Qor = 0.4 mL·min−1, and Qaq = 0.9 mL· min−1, with the selectivity of o-NB, m-NB, p-NB, and DNB being 7.26%, 0.08%, 90.97%, and 1.04%, respectively. Encouraged by the lab-scale results, the scale-up of the nitration of TFM

The quartz sand microparticles with an average size of 710 μm were packed in the tubular reactor at a porosity of 0.39. It is observed from Figure 7a that TFMB is totally converted at the low ﬂow rate and then the conversion decreases directly with the increasing ﬂow rate. Given such a low volume of the microreactor system, multiply increasing ﬂow rates lead to a shorter residence time which is no

with the conversion of TFMB being 99.6%. The results showed that the microreactor coupled with distributed packed tubular reactor could conduct the continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB well with a good performance. The precise control of temperature distribution and the eﬃcient mixing in micro- reactor ensured the nitration reaction proceeded at a fast rate and minimized the formation of the byproduct

Therefore, the selectivity of m- NB and DNB should be controlled as low as possible to cut the cost of the separation. The objective was to minimize the byproduct selectivity (m-NB < 0.1%, DNB < 1.5%) without decline of the product yield, which could bring signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts in saving costs of downstream separation and products puriﬁcation. First, the eﬀects of process parameters on the c

The organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution and deionized water for several times to remove the dissolved trace acid and inorganic substances, respectively. Then, the product was analyzed by GC. The reaction conditions were optimized by changing various parameters, including the temperature, the sulfuric acid strength, the residence time, the molar ratio of nitric acid to TFMB, ﬂow

Therefore, it is very important and urgent to develop a new strategy based on process intensiﬁcation technology to improve the productivity and process safety. As a typical process intensiﬁcation technology, the micro- reactor has opened up new horizons both in academia and industry. Owing to the characteristic dimension of submillim- eter, the microreactor possesses a large surface-to-volume rati

(4.7 s), the mixture was delivered into the packed tubular reactor with a residence time being 2.8 min. Following the workup of the mixture stream, the products were collected and analyzed by GC. As shown in Table 1, about 89.75% of p-NB, 6.9% of o-NB, and byproducts (0.11% of m- NB and 3.17% of DNB) were detected in the products. As mentioned above, the selectivities of byproducts were sensitive 

Encouraged by these results, the scale up of the nitration process of TFMB was further performed. As the conversion of TFMB could be dramatically increased by packing microparticles, the microreactor combined with the packed tubular reactor was chosen as the basic unit for the scaling up in this section, and several diﬀerent strategies about packed tubular reactor were tested to obtain the best re

On the basis of the results of the strategy A, a new optimized strategy (Figure 9) was then proposed. Four tubular reactors with smaller diameter (stainless tube, 8 mm o.d., 6 mm i.d.) were used to take place the front half of the tubular reaction system, while the other half of reactor remained the same. A distributed design of the tubular reactors would be beneﬁcial for the heat transfer of the 

Besides, the residence times in the experiments of this section is not long enough for the complete conversion of reactant TFMB, which decreases the occurrence of side reaction to some extent. 2.1.5. Eﬀect of Flow Rate. The ﬂow rate is a vital parameter in conducting nitration reaction. In this section, the length of the microchannel was kept constant, which meant that the residence time decreased

GC analysis was performed on an Agilent 7890B with ﬂame ionization detector using a HP1701 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 1.0 μm), and helium was the carrier gas (1 mL·min−1 constant ﬂow). After 1 min, the temperature was increased from 80 to 280 °C at a rate of 12 °C·min−1 and kept constant at 280 °C for 10 min. The hydrogen ﬂow rate was 30 mL·min−1; the front inlet temperature was 260 °C, and the dete

To take advantage of the enhanced mass transfer brought by the packed microparticles, several methods are set up to deal with the heat transfer problem in packed microchannel system during the scale up experiments, such as distributing the released heat, changing the size of packed microparticles, and reducing the reaction temperature. 2.2. Scale-up of the TFMB Nitration. As stated above, a broad 

Triﬂuoromethoxy aniline is an important intermediate involved in the synthesis of a wide range of ﬁne chemicals, for example, pesticides,1 pharmaceuticals,2 and liquid crystal materials.3 It is generally produced via the nitration of triﬂuoromethoxyben- zene (TFMB) with mixed acid followed by reduction of nitration products. Generally, the nitration reactions are often diﬃcult to control due to it

The process is amenable for the preparation of analogous compounds and can easily be scaled-up by either increasing reactor size or numbering up the reactors in parallel. Further development of this procedure is currently ongoing in our laboratory. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 4.1. General. GC calibration curves were measured for triﬂuoromethoxybenzene (TFMB), mononitration product (p- NB, m-NB and o-N

Brocklehurst et al.8 used a commercially available continuous ﬂow reactor to perform the challenging nitration of 2-amino-4-bromobenzoic acid methyl ester with a 84% yield and 70 g/h production rate. Noticeably, no byproduct was obtained, which greatly simpliﬁed the process of the workup. Apart from those substantial advantages presented above, with the numbering-up strategy, the small scaling eﬀe

TFMB and product selectivity. It can be seen from Figure 6a that the conversion of TFMB decreases slightly with the increase in ﬂow rate. On one hand, as the ﬂow rate increased from 1.3 to 3.2 mL·min−1, the residence time decreased from 8.0 to 3.2 s, which leaded a lower conversion of TFMB. On the other hand, higher ﬂow rate will also enhance mass transfer rate,15 which beneﬁted TFMB nitration. Ev

nitro group is a deactivating group, so it would be harder for NO2 + to attack the mononitration products. Therefore, the higher reaction temperature would be conductive to the DNB formation. 2.1.2. Eﬀect of Residence Time. Residence time is another important parameter which aﬀects the reagent conversion and product selectivity. Too short of a residence time may lead to a low conversion of reagent

The eﬀect of residence time was investigated under the reaction conditions of N/S = 0.2, N/F = 0.86, T = 278 K, Qor = 0.5 mL·min−1, Qaq = 1.2 mL·min−1. Figure 3 demonstrates the eﬀect of residence time on the conversion of TFMB and product selectivity. It is observed that a longer residence time will result in a higher conversion of TFMB, especially with mixed acid of a higher sulfuric acid streng

As shown in Figure 4a, conversion of TFMB increases with increasing sulfuric acid strength. Considering that nitration reactions with

Similarly, the unchanged selectivity of DNB can also be explained by that. 2.1.4. Eﬀect of the Molar Ratio of HNO3/TFMB. As we all know, an appropriate molar ratio of reaction reagents can promote the conversion of reagent and enhance the selectivity of desired product. In addition, it can also simplify the workup procedure and reduce the waste. The eﬀect of molar ratio of HNO3/TFMB on the convers

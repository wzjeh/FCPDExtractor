- Normalize all temperature values to °C for consistency in units across the JSON object.

- Do not add extra fields beyond the JSON schema or alter the data in any way other than to meet its structure.

- In the case of "inner_diameter" field, use lowercase (e.g., "20 mm").

- Do not modify the units of values in the original text; only normalize to standardized units (e.g., °C for temperature, min for residence time).

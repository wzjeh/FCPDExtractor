ABSTRACT: In this work, continuous ﬂow nitration of triﬂuoromethoxybenzene (TFMB) was conducted in a microchannel
reactor. The eﬀects of process parameters, including temperature, residence time, sulfuric acid strength, ﬂow rate, and reactor
structure, were systemically investigated. It was found that the aforementioned process parameters had signiﬁcant eﬀect on
TFMB conversion, while the product selectivity was merely sensitive to the reaction temperature. On the basis of the results of
process parameter optimization, a scale-up strategy combining microreactor with distributed packed tubular reactor was
presented. Consequently, excellent performance was achieved in the combined reactor with a kilogram-scale production.
1. INTRODUCTION
Triﬂuoromethoxy aniline is an important intermediate involved
in the synthesis of a wide range of ﬁne chemicals, for example,
pesticides,1 pharmaceuticals,2 and liquid crystal materials.3 It is
generally produced via the nitration of triﬂuoromethoxyben-
zene (TFMB) with mixed acid followed by reduction of
nitration products. Generally, the nitration reactions are often
diﬃcult to control due to its extremely fast rate and highly
exothermic nature, with the reaction heat ranging from −73 to
−253 kJ·mol−1.4 Due to the ineﬃcient transport properties of
stirred batch reactors, the nitration of TFMB (Figure 1) is
always operated at very low reaction temperature (263 K),
reactant concentration, and adding rate of mixed acid (28 h) to
achieve a mild condition and inhibit the formation of undesired
products (m-NB and DNB). Apparently, the nitration of TFMB
in stirred batch reactor is a time-consuming and low-eﬃciency
process.5 Therefore, it is very important and urgent to develop
a new strategy based on process intensiﬁcation technology to
improve the productivity and process safety.
As a typical process intensiﬁcation technology, the micro-
reactor has opened up new horizons both in academia and
industry. Owing to the characteristic dimension of submillim-
eter, the microreactor possesses a large surface-to-volume ratio,
enhanced mass and heat transfer rate, precise control over
reaction parameters, high integration, and inherent process
safety,6 which hold great promise for very fast and highly
exothermic reactions. The microreactor has been applied to
intensify the nitration reaction recently.7 Yu et al.7d proposed a
continuous ﬂow nitration process to produce 2,5-diﬂuoroni-
trobenzene, and a 98% yield with an output being 6.25 kg/h
was realized. In addition, the shorter residence time (2.3 min)
in microreactor meant higher eﬃciency in comparison to the
batch reactor (>1 h). Brocklehurst et al.8 used a commercially
available continuous ﬂow reactor to perform the challenging
nitration of 2-amino-4-bromobenzoic acid methyl ester with a
84% yield and 70 g/h production rate. Noticeably, no
byproduct was obtained, which greatly simpliﬁed the process
of the workup. Apart from those substantial advantages
presented above, with the numbering-up strategy, the small
scaling eﬀect of microreactor makes the laboratory results easier
to industrialize.9 Gage et al.10 reported the continuous ﬂow
nitration of 5-bromo-2-amino-4-methylpyridine from kilogram
scale in the laboratory to 100 kg scale in the plant with a 99.7%
purity and 50% yield.
In this study, we performed the continuous ﬂow nitration of
TFMB in the microreactor system. Considering that the next
step of the nitration of TFMB was the reduction of the
mononitration product, it was diﬃcult to separate isomers of
triﬂuoromethoxybenzenamine. Therefore, the selectivity of m-
NB and DNB should be controlled as low as possible to cut the
cost of the separation. The objective was to minimize the
byproduct selectivity (m-NB < 0.1%, DNB < 1.5%) without
decline of the product yield, which could bring signiﬁcant
economic beneﬁts in saving costs of downstream separation
and products puriﬁcation. First, the eﬀects of process
parameters on the conversion of TFMB and product selectivity
were investigated in detail. The best performance in terms of
yield and selectivity was obtained by means of process
optimization. Subsequently, on the basis of the results of
process development, a scale-up strategy which combined a
multichannel microreactor with a distributed packed tubular
reactor was proposed, and kilogram-scale production was
achieved in the combined reactor.
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Process Development. 2.1.1. Eﬀect of the Reaction
Temperature. The reaction temperature plays a signiﬁcant role
in the process of nitration reaction. Given that aromatic
nitration reaction is a typically heterogeneous reaction,
temperature inﬂuences not only the mass transfer of organic
compounds into the acid phase, but also the intrinsic reaction

rate. Figure 2 shows the eﬀect of reaction temperature on the
conversion of TFMB and product selectivities at diﬀerent
residence times. The main product is p-NB that counts more
than 90% of the products due to the small rotation barrier of
the OCF3 group.11 The product selectivity follows the order p-
NB > o-NB > m-NB. With the increase of reaction temperature,
the selectivity of p-NB decreases, while those of m-NB and o-
NB increase. According to our previous research, it was due to
that the activation energies of ortho- and meta-nitrations are
larger than that of para-nitration. It is reasonable that attacking
the ortho-position and meta-position of the aromatic ring by
NO2
+ are more diﬃcult, considering the rotational barrier in
TFMB molecules. Therefore, higher temperature is propitious
to promote the ortho- and meta-nitrations. As we all know, the

nitro group is a deactivating group, so it would be harder for
NO2
+ to attack the mononitration products. Therefore, the
higher reaction temperature would be conductive to the DNB
formation.
2.1.2. Eﬀect of Residence Time. Residence time is another
important parameter which aﬀects the reagent conversion and
product selectivity. Too short of a residence time may lead to a
low conversion of reagent, while a long residence time would
let reagent pointlessly ﬂow inside the microreactor, and some
intermediates may convert to side product, decreasing the
selectivity of the main product.12 Similarly, excessive nitration
may occur during a prolonged residence time and produce
undesired products in nitration reaction. Therefore, the
residence time should be precisely controlled to obtain the
highest yield of desired product. In this section, the residence
time of the experiment was changed by varying the length of
microchannel reactor. The eﬀect of residence time was
investigated under the reaction conditions of N/S = 0.2, N/F
= 0.86, T = 278 K, Qor = 0.5 mL·min−1, Qaq = 1.2 mL·min−1.
Figure 3 demonstrates the eﬀect of residence time on the
conversion of TFMB and product selectivity. It is observed that
a longer residence time will result in a higher conversion of
TFMB, especially with mixed acid of a higher sulfuric acid
strength. Nevertheless, the product selectivity nearly remains
unchanged with the increasing residence time during the
experiments, which may due to the fact that the residence time
is not long enough to reﬂect its inﬂuence on the product
selectivity.
2.1.3. Eﬀect of Sulfuric Acid Strength. It is widely accepted
that, when a nitration reaction is carried out with the mixed

acid, sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst, which protonates nitric acid
and generates NO2
+ ions.13 Therefore, to obtain the optimized
process parameters, the eﬀect of sulfuric acid strength on the
conversion of TFMB and product selectivity should be studied
in detail. As shown in Figure 4a, conversion of TFMB increases
with increasing sulfuric acid strength. Considering that nitration
reactions with mixed acid generally are heterogeneous, higher
sulfuric acid strength not only promotes the generation of
NO2
+ ions but also increases the solubility and mass transfer
rate of TFMB in acid phase.14 Both of these enhance the
nitration rate and then result in a high conversion of TFMB. As
displayed in Figure 4b and c, the product selectivities are nearly
not aﬀected with the increase in sulfuric acid strength. This is
due to the fact that the reactions of para-, ortho-, and meta-
nitrations are parallel and the reaction improvements caused by
increasing sulfuric acid strength are similar. Similarly, the
unchanged selectivity of DNB can also be explained by that.
2.1.4. Eﬀect of the Molar Ratio of HNO3/TFMB. As we all
know, an appropriate molar ratio of reaction reagents can
promote the conversion of reagent and enhance the selectivity
of desired product. In addition, it can also simplify the workup
procedure and reduce the waste. The eﬀect of molar ratio of
HNO3/TFMB on the conversion of TFMB and product
selectivity is presented in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, it is
found that the conversion of TFMB increases with increasing
molar ratio, while the product selectivities remains unchanged.
This is attributed to more NO2
+ ions generated for nitration. As
for the unchanged product selectivities, this is due to the fact
that the mononitration reactions are parallel and the reaction
orders are identical. Besides, the residence times in the
experiments of this section is not long enough for the complete
conversion of reactant TFMB, which decreases the occurrence
of side reaction to some extent.
2.1.5. Eﬀect of Flow Rate. The ﬂow rate is a vital parameter
in conducting nitration reaction. In this section, the length of
the microchannel was kept constant, which meant that the
residence time decreased with the increasing ﬂow rate. Figure 6
demonstrates the eﬀect of ﬂow rate on the conversion of

TFMB and product selectivity. It can be seen from Figure 6a
that the conversion of TFMB decreases slightly with the
increase in ﬂow rate. On one hand, as the ﬂow rate increased
from 1.3 to 3.2 mL·min−1, the residence time decreased from
8.0 to 3.2 s, which leaded a lower conversion of TFMB. On the
other hand, higher ﬂow rate will also enhance mass transfer
rate,15 which beneﬁted TFMB nitration. Evidently, increasing
total ﬂow rate exerted an opposite eﬀect on the conversion of
TFMB. As a result, TFMB conversion was determined by the
integrated outcome of these two changes. It also implicates that
these nitration processes are still limited by mass transfer in the
microchemical system. As shown in Figure 6b−d, the product
selectivities of mononitrations nearly remain unchanged with
the increasing ﬂow rate, which indicates that the performance
of microreactor in heat transfer is excellent. It is obvious in
Figure 6e that the selectivity of dinitration product decreases
sharply with the increase in ﬂow rate. A faster ﬂow rate would
result in a better mixing eﬀect, which can make the organic
compound more evenly dispersed in the acid phase. Besides, a
faster ﬂow rate would also decrease the residence time.
Therefore, a faster ﬂow rate could reduce the occurrence of
dinitration.
2.1.6. Eﬀect of Reactor Structure. Considering that the
nitration processes were limited by the mass transfer in
microchannel systems, the method of packing microparticles
(micro packed-bed reactor) was taken up to intensify mass
transfer process between the mixed acid and compound TFMB
in microchannel system. In our previous work, it was found that
better mixing and reaction performance could be obtained in
the packed microchannel system because of its excellent mass
transfer performance.7c,16 In this section, the reaction system
consisted of a microchannel reactor (length 0.1 m, inner
diameter 0.6 mm) and a packed tubular reactor (length 0.3 m,
inner diameter 6 mm). The quartz sand microparticles with an
average size of 710 μm were packed in the tubular reactor at a
porosity of 0.39. It is observed from Figure 7a that TFMB is
totally converted at the low ﬂow rate and then the conversion
decreases directly with the increasing ﬂow rate. Given such a
low volume of the microreactor system, multiply increasing
ﬂow rates lead to a shorter residence time which is not enough
for the full nitration of TFMB. The eﬀect of the ﬂow rate on
product selectivities in a packed microchannel system are
presented in Figure 7b, c, which are similar to the results
mentioned in former section. What is diﬀerent is that the
variation of the product selectivities in this section is larger than
that of former section, which also indicates that packing
microparticles poses a challenge to the heat transfer in
microchannel reactor. To take advantage of the enhanced
mass transfer brought by the packed microparticles, several
methods are set up to deal with the heat transfer problem in
packed microchannel system during the scale up experiments,
such as distributing the released heat, changing the size of
packed microparticles, and reducing the reaction temperature.
2.2. Scale-up of the TFMB Nitration. As stated above, a
broad range of reaction parameters for triﬂuoromethoxyben-
zene nitration process were investigated. The highest
conversion (99.6%) was achieved in the microchannel coupled
with packed tubular reactor system under the reaction
conditions of N/S = 0.25, N/F = 1.1, φ = 97 wt %, T = 273
K, Qor = 0.4 mL·min−1, and Qaq = 0.9 mL·min−1, with the
selectivity of o-NB, m-NB, p-NB, and DNB being 7.26%, 0.08%,
90.97%, and 1.04%, respectively. Encouraged by these results,
the scale up of the nitration process of TFMB was further
performed. As the conversion of TFMB could be dramatically
increased by packing microparticles, the microreactor combined
with the packed tubular reactor was chosen as the basic unit for
the scaling up in this section, and several diﬀerent strategies
about packed tubular reactor were tested to obtain the best
reaction performance.
2.2.1. Strategy A. The tubular reactor in Entry 1 consisted of
four packed tubular reactors (stainless tube, length 1 × 675 mm
+ 3 × 900 mm, 12 mm o.d., 9 mm i.d.) with a porosity being
0.46. The size of the cylindrical quartz sand was 2 mm in
diameter and 2 mm in length (Φ2 × 2). Figure 8 show the
scaling-up experimental setup of the continuous ﬂow nitration
process. TFMB and mixed acid were pumped with the volume
ﬂow rate of 10 mL·min−1 and 24.5 mL·min−1, respectively. The
mixture then ﬂowed through the microreactor which was
cooled by running water. After the quick mixing in microreactor

(4.7 s), the mixture was delivered into the packed tubular
reactor with a residence time being 2.8 min.
Following the workup of the mixture stream, the products
were collected and analyzed by GC. As shown in Table 1, about
89.75% of p-NB, 6.9% of o-NB, and byproducts (0.11% of m-
NB and 3.17% of DNB) were detected in the products. As
mentioned above, the selectivities of byproducts were sensitive
to temperature. The temperature rise of the ﬂowing stream in
the ﬁrst coiler was found to be evidently high due to the fast
nitration reaction in the ﬁrst coiler, which was accompanied by
much reaction heat. To avoid the sharp temperature rise, the
reaction should proceed in a controlled manner. According to
our previous work,16 a smaller size of microparticles used in the
packed tubular reactor leaded a higher eﬀective interfacial area
and better mixing eﬃciency. Hence, the size of the packed
quartz sand in the ﬁrst coiler was changed from Φ2 × 2 to Φ3
× 3, while other three coilers remained the same (Entry 2). It
can be seen from Table 1 that the selectivities of the main
product increased, while the byproducts decreased. However,
the selectivity of DNB was still beyond our expectation. To
further decrease the selectivity of byproduct DNB, another
adjustment was adopted. The Φ3 × 3 quartz sand was still used
to replace the Φ2 × 2 one (Entry 3). The selectivities of the
byproducts decreased as we expected. Unfortunately, the
conversion of TFMB also decreased (95.29%), which
demonstrated that enlarging the size of the packed particles
would slow down the reaction rate and further decrease the
reaction heat. The key issue was pointed out to be distributing
the reaction heat and controlling the reaction temperature
without slowing down the reaction rate.
2.2.2. Strategy B. On the basis of the results of the strategy
A, a new optimized strategy (Figure 9) was then proposed.
Four tubular reactors with smaller diameter (stainless tube, 8
mm o.d., 6 mm i.d.) were used to take place the front half of the
tubular reaction system, while the other half of reactor
remained the same. A distributed design of the tubular reactors
would be beneﬁcial for the heat transfer of the reaction. And
the packed Φ2 × 2 cylindrical quartz sand could also ensure the
relatively quick reaction rate and that product TFMB was
completely converted. As presented in Table 2, the optimal
conditions were achieved by ﬂowing TFMB and mixed acid
[solution of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid
(1:4)] at the rate of 10 mL·min−1 and 24.2 mL·min−1 (total
residence time being 2.4 min) and controlling the reaction
temperature below −2 °C. 91.08% of p-NB, 7.05% of o-NB, and
only trace of m-NB (0.08%) and DNB (1.34%) were obtained,

with the conversion of TFMB being 99.6%. The results showed
that the microreactor coupled with distributed packed tubular
reactor could conduct the continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB
well with a good performance. The precise control of
temperature distribution and the eﬃcient mixing in micro-
reactor ensured the nitration reaction proceeded at a fast rate
and minimized the formation of the byproducts compared to
that in a batch system.
3. CONCLUSION
In summary, experiments were performed to study the eﬀects
of reaction parameters in the process development of the
continuous ﬂow nitration of TFMB thoroughly. The
conversion and selectivity of the products were investigated
by changing various parameters, including residence time,
reaction temperature, sulfuric acid strength, molar ratio, ﬂow
rate, and reactor structure. The highest conversion (99.6%) of
reactant was obtained in the microchannel coupled with tubular
reactor system at the condition of N/S = 0.25, N/F = 1.1, φ =
97 wt %, T = 273 K, Qor = 0.4 mL·min−1, and Qaq = 0.9 mL·
min−1, with the selectivity of o-NB, m-NB, p-NB, and DNB
being 7.26%, 0.08%, 90.97%, and 1.04%, respectively.
Encouraged by the lab-scale results, the scale-up of the
nitration of TFMB with several strategies were performed. A
0.99 kg/h throughput was achieved in the microreactor coupled
with distributed packed tubal reactor system, with the
selectivity of main products being 98.13% and byproducts
being limited below 1.42% (0.08% of m-NB and 1.34% of
DNB). The process is amenable for the preparation of
analogous compounds and can easily be scaled-up by either
increasing reactor size or numbering up the reactors in parallel.
Further development of this procedure is currently ongoing in
our laboratory.
4. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
4.1. General. GC calibration curves were measured for
triﬂuoromethoxybenzene (TFMB), mononitration product (p-
NB, m-NB and o-NB), dinitration product (DNB), and
nitrobenzene as external standard for quantitative yield
calculations. For the GC assay yields, area responses were
normalized with respect to nitrobenzene as the external
standard and corrected for molar relative response factors.
The components (retention time) observed by GC were:
TFMB (4.6 min), m-NB (9.9 min), p-NB (10.2 min), o-NB
(10.6 min), and DNB (14.5 min). GC analysis was performed
on an Agilent 7890B with ﬂame ionization detector using a
HP1701 column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 1.0 μm), and helium was
the carrier gas (1 mL·min−1 constant ﬂow). After 1 min, the
temperature was increased from 80 to 280 °C at a rate of 12
°C·min−1 and kept constant at 280 °C for 10 min. The
hydrogen ﬂow rate was 30 mL·min−1; the front inlet
temperature was 260 °C, and the detection temperature was
300 °C. The purity and supplier for each chemical were:
triﬂuoromethoxybenzene (99% purity, Qi-Chem), sulfuric acid
(98 wt %, Kemiou), fuming nitric acid (98 wt %, Kemiou),
sodium bicarbonate (99.5% purity, Kemiou), sodium chloride
(99.5% purity, BoDi), and ethylene glycol (99.0% purity,
Sinopharm).
4.2. General Laboratory Process Developmental
Procedure. The general laboratory process developments
were carried out in microchannel reactors. TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow
rate of 0.4−1.0 mL·min−1) and a solution of fuming nitric acid
in concentrated sulfuric acid (2.49−3.19 M, ﬂow rate of 0.8−
2.2 mL·min−1) were delivered by two syringe pumps (TYD01-
02, Lead Fluid), respectively. The ﬂuids reacted in capillaries
with a length deﬁned by the desired residence times and ﬂow
rates. The reaction temperature was controlled by a thermostat
(F12-ME refrigerated/heating circulator, Julabo). The precool-
ing unit, micromixer, microchannel reactor, and microneutral-
izer were all made up of stainless steel with an inner diameter
being 0.6 mm, and immerged in the thermostat to obtain a
uniform reaction temperature. At the outlet, the reaction was
quenched by a large amount of water ﬂow (10 mL·min−1). The
product was collected into a small beaker containing ice
deionized water and separated via a separatory funnel. The
organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution
and deionized water for several times to remove the dissolved
trace acid and inorganic substances, respectively. Then, the
product was analyzed by GC. The reaction conditions were
optimized by changing various parameters, including the
temperature, the sulfuric acid strength, the residence time,
the molar ratio of nitric acid to TFMB, ﬂow rate, and reactor
structure.
4.3. General Scale-up Process. A microreactor, consisting
of four plates, 16 channels per plate with the size and total
volume of microchannels being 1 mm × 0.5 mm × 85 mm and
2.72 mL, was combined with a tubular packed reactor to
conduct the scale-up of continuous ﬂow nitration. The tubular
packed reactor was made up by several coilers with diﬀerent
length and size, and two kinds of average size of cylindrical
quartz sand microparticles were used as packed particles, the
average diameters of which are 2 mm and 3 mm, respectively.
TFMB (7.57 M, ﬂow rate of 10−20 mL·min−1) and a solution
of fuming nitric acid in concentrated sulfuric acid (3.19 M, ﬂow
rate of 24−39 mL·min−1) were pumped into microreactor by
two metering pumps (P1, P2, SSI, USA), respectively. The
temperature of the microreactor was controlled by the
microchannel heat exchanger which is integrated in the
microreactor system. Then the mixed solution was introduced
into the tubular packed reactor, which was put into a sink
contained the cold sodium chloride solution (15%, −9 °C) to
maintain the reaction temperature. At the outlet, the product
was collected into product tank (3 L) containing ice deionized
water and then separated via a separatory funnel. The organic
phase was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution and
deionized water for several times. Then 0.99 kg/h of desired
product o-NB and p-NB were obtained as yellow liquid with a
GC purity of 7.05% and 91.08%, while the selectivity of the

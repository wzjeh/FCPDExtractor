Recently, we have established on-surface syntheses of indenoﬂuorene polymers by utilizing oxidative cyclization of methyl groups against phenylene rings of polyphenylene backbones,25,26 an alternative strategy to dehydrogenation of dihydroindenoﬂuorene precursors by the STM tip.27 We have considered that increasing the number of methyl groups on the PPP backbone in this system can lead to PInIns. Here, we report an unprecedented on-surface synthesis of para-type oligo(indenoindene) (p-OInIn, 4) on Au(111), starting from dibromo-trimethyl-p-terphenyl 1 as the precursor (Scheme 1). A sequence of thermally activated reactions led to atomically precise segments of the targeted p-OInIn 4, although defects, mainly due to isomerization and incomplete dehydrogenation of methylene carbons, were overall present. p-OInIn 4 was characterized by means of low-temperature STM/STS and nc- Received: May 29, 2020 Published: July 14, 2020 Scheme 1.

The observed polymers were no longer packed into islands. This change can be attributed to the desorption of bromine atoms from the Au(111) surface, which is known to be promoted by the presence of atomic hydrogen,32,33 and to occur in this temperature range.34 Moreover, some T-shape connections between the polymers appeared (see Figure S1c), most likely arising from undesired coupling reactions between the terminal radicals and methyl groups on the backbones. The oxidative cyclization of methyl groups was (nearly) completed after annealing the sample to 360 °C (Figure 1f). This on-surface reaction is most probably initiated by the homolytic cleavage of the benzylic C−H bond, namely of the methyl group, considering its higher reactivity compared to that of the phenyl C−H bond. A zigzag appearance of the resulting polymers suggested the formation of ﬁve-membered rings on alternating sides of the polymer backbones, even though long-range order of such pattern was lacking.

AFM, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing structural and electronic insights into this elusive CLP. To achieve the formation of the desired ladder polymer, precursor 1 was sublimed onto a clean Au(111) surface held at room temperature (RT) in UHV. STM images of the resulting adsorbate layer show intact molecules of precursor 1 that form self-assembled domains, stabilized by Br···H interactions (Figure 1a,b; see also Figure S1 for large scale STM images of all the investigated phases). Annealing this sample to 160 °C led to homolytic cleavage of (most of) the C−Br bonds and C−C bond formation between the generated diradical species to form methyl substituted oligo-p-phenylene 2, which was still terminated with bromine atoms (Figure 1c,d).23,28−31 The dissociated bromine atoms chemisorbed onto the Au(111) surface and stabilized islands of packed oligomers 2.

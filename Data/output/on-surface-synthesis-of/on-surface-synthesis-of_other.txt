ABSTRACT: Fully conjugated ladder polymers (CLP) possess unique optical and electronic properties and are considered
promising materials for applications in (opto)electronic devices. Poly(indenoindene) is a CLP consisting of an alternating array of
ﬁve- and six-membered rings, which has remained elusive so far. Here, we report an on-surface synthesis of oligo(indenoindene) on
Au(111). Its structure and a low electronic band gap have been elucidated by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, complemented by density functional theory calculations. Achieving defect-
free segments of oligo(indenoindene) oﬀers exclusive insight into this CLP and provides the basis to further synthetic approaches.
C
onjugated ladder polymers (CLPs) have attracted
extensive attention for their intriguing properties distinct
from the conventional conjugated polymers.1−5 In virtue of
their fully conjugated and rigid polymer backbone, CLPs hold
promise for high mobility of charge carriers,6,7 long exciton
diﬀusion length,8 and low energy gaps.5,9−14 CLPs can be
synthesized by either direct ladder polymerization, simulta-
neously forming two covalent bonds between monomer units,
or “zipping” of a prepolymer decorated with proper functional
groups that can form additional bonds.1−3,15
A particular class of CLPs is represented by an extension of
indenoﬂuorene16 into a polymer, that is poly(indenoindene)
(PInIn), where the alternation of ﬁve- and six-membered rings
gives rise to the ladder structure.17−20 The synthesis of PInIns
was pioneered by Scherf and Müllen in 1992, but the ﬁnal
dehydrogenation step did not proceed completely, and
unambiguous structural proof could not be obtained.21 More
recently, Wu et al. synthesized a short segment of PInIn with
four and ﬁve pentagons and hexagons, respectively,17 but more
extended PInIns have remained elusive.
On-surface synthesis has become a powerful tool for the
preparation of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks
and quasi-one-dimensional graphene nanoribbons with various
structures and properties by rational design of small-molecule
precursors.4,22−24 Under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions,
chemical and electronic structures of the resulting products can
be in situ visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy/
spectroscopy (STM/STS) and noncontact atomic force
microscopy (nc-AFM), providing their unambiguous charac-
terizations.
Recently, we have established on-surface syntheses of
indenoﬂuorene polymers by utilizing oxidative cyclization of
methyl groups against phenylene rings of polyphenylene
backbones,25,26 an alternative strategy to dehydrogenation of
dihydroindenoﬂuorene precursors by the STM tip.27 We have
considered that increasing the number of methyl groups on the
PPP backbone in this system can lead to PInIns. Here, we
report an unprecedented on-surface synthesis of para-type
oligo(indenoindene) (p-OInIn, 4) on Au(111), starting from
dibromo-trimethyl-p-terphenyl 1 as the precursor (Scheme 1).
A sequence of thermally activated reactions led to atomically
precise segments of the targeted p-OInIn 4, although defects,
mainly due to isomerization and incomplete dehydrogenation
of methylene carbons, were overall present. p-OInIn 4 was
characterized by means of low-temperature STM/STS and nc-

AFM, complemented by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, providing structural and electronic insights into
this elusive CLP.
To achieve the formation of the desired ladder polymer,
precursor 1 was sublimed onto a clean Au(111) surface held at
room temperature (RT) in UHV. STM images of the resulting
adsorbate layer show intact molecules of precursor 1 that form
self-assembled domains, stabilized by Br···H interactions
(Figure 1a,b; see also Figure S1 for large scale STM images
of all the investigated phases). Annealing this sample to 160 °C
led to homolytic cleavage of (most of) the C−Br bonds and
C−C bond formation between the generated diradical species
to form methyl substituted oligo-p-phenylene 2, which was still
terminated with bromine atoms (Figure 1c,d).23,28−31 The
dissociated bromine atoms chemisorbed onto the Au(111)
surface and stabilized islands of packed oligomers 2. The
presence of diagonal features in the oligomer backbones
suggested that the methyl groups had not reacted at this
annealing step, as previously reported for similar systems.25,26
Oligomer 2 had a length distribution mostly ranging from 2 to
10 repeat units (m = 0−8 in Scheme 1). Annealing the sample
to 250 °C promoted complete debromination of the terminal
sites accompanied by further polymer growth. The appearance
of the chains was more disordered (Figure 1e), which
suggested that beyond the formation of methyl substituted
poly-p-phenylene (PPP) chains 3, additional reactions
involving part of the methyl groups took place. Phenylene
rings in polymer 3 could undergo torsional rotation, changing
the alternation of methyl groups along the polymer chains
(e.g., 3-I and 3-II in Scheme 1) in a dynamic manner (vide
infra).25 Methyl cyclization and partial dehydrogenation were
initiated at this temperature, aﬀording methylene bridges (3-
III in Scheme 1) randomly distributed along the chains. The
observed polymers were no longer packed into islands. This
change can be attributed to the desorption of bromine atoms
from the Au(111) surface, which is known to be promoted by
the presence of atomic hydrogen,32,33 and to occur in this
temperature range.34 Moreover, some T-shape connections
between the polymers appeared (see Figure S1c), most likely
arising from undesired coupling reactions between the terminal
radicals and methyl groups on the backbones.
The oxidative cyclization of methyl groups was (nearly)
completed after annealing the sample to 360 °C (Figure 1f).
This on-surface reaction is most probably initiated by the
homolytic cleavage of the benzylic C−H bond, namely of the
methyl group, considering its higher reactivity compared to
that of the phenyl C−H bond. A zigzag appearance of the
resulting polymers suggested the formation of ﬁve-membered
rings on alternating sides of the polymer backbones, even
though long-range order of such pattern was lacking.
Nevertheless, some polymer segments had a well-deﬁned,
regular spacing between the characteristic features correspond-
ing to the ﬁve-membered rings, as visible in the STM image in
Figure 2a. We subsequently performed constant-height STM
imaging with a CO-functionalized tip, which resulted in the
ultrahigh resolution STM (UHR-STM) image in Figure 2b.
Thereby, an alternation of ﬁve- and six-membered rings could
be clearly discerned. To unambiguously resolve the structure of
such segments, constant-height frequency-shift nc-AFM
imaging with a CO-functionalized tip35 was carried out (Figure
2c). The resulting image identiﬁed the chemical structure of
this segment as the desired ladder oligomer p-OInIn 4. Hence,
the methyl groups had cyclized to the neighboring phenylene
rings, releasing two hydrogen atoms and forming methine
bridges on alternating sides of the PPP backbone (Figure 2c
and d).
We attribute the lack of long-range order in the position of
the ﬁve-membered rings along the polymer axis to rotation of
polymer subunits before cyclization (see structures 3-I and 3-II
in Scheme 1). The rotation of an ortho-methyl substituted
phenylene ring of a PPP chain on Au(111) exhibits an energy
barrier of only 0.7 eV (computed by the nudged elastic band
method), which can be overcome at the experimental
conditions during the annealing procedure,25 thus producing
the observed defects. Therefore, the targeted p-OInIn 4 with
regularly alternating ﬁve- and six-membered rings was achieved
only when the methyl groups were organized with the desired
consecutive alternation. In other cases, constitutional isomers
of 4 with diﬀerent orientations of ﬁve- and six-membered rings

were observed (see Figures 3 and S2). Figure 3 shows some
examples of defective structures identiﬁed by nc-AFM.
Methylene (−CH2−) bridges were observed as brighter
features (red arrows), which are attributed to incomplete
dehydrogenation after heating at 360 °C for 10 min. The
presence of two ﬁve-membered rings at the same polymer site
(green arrows) was also detected, indicating that the undesired
head-to-head coupling may proceed even with two ortho-
methyl groups facing each other. Single bonds were addition-
ally discerned (blue arrows), hindering complete ladderization.
The absence of the ﬁve-membered rings at these positions may
be ascribed to either (i) tail-to-tail linkage of the precursor
molecules or (ii) loss of methyl groups during the annealing, as
observed also in other segments (see Figure S2). From the nc-
AFM images (Figures 2, 3, and S2), we could ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
amount of defect-free units in the ladders. Regrettably, the
presence of the above-mentioned irregularities (even if in small
amount) limits the defect-free ladders to rather short segments
of about 3 nm; hence, we identify them as oligomers p-OInIn
4. However, in the following we will show that even these short
segments are long enough to be representative of the electronic
properties of longer ladder polymers.
After a critical assessment of the possible defects, we
characterized the electronic properties of a p-OInIn 4. A
voltage-dependent diﬀerential conductance spectrum (dI/dV
vs V) acquired on an ∼3 nm long defect-free segment of 4
revealed peaks in the density of states (DOS) at −0.75, −0.35,
and +0.45 V (Figure 4a). Spatial dI/dV mapping at these
voltages agreed well with DFT-computed local DOS (LDOS)
maps for HOMO−1, HOMO, and LUMO, respectively, for an
oligomer of 4 (ﬁnite system with the length of 8.6 nm, Figure
S3) adsorbed on Au(111), which conﬁrmed the origin of the
observed DOS peaks (Figures 4b−g and S4). We computed an
oligomer longer than the experimentally characterized segment
in order to avoid limitations due to ﬁnite-size eﬀects (see
Figure S3). The good match observed in Figure 4 shows that
the experimentally investigated segment is representative of
longer polymers. The band gap of p-OInIn 4 on Au(111) was
determined to be 0.8 eV based on the dI/dV spectrum. On the
other hand, DFT calculations indicated the HOMO−LUMO
gap of the oligomer of 4 on Au(111) to be 0.22 eV (identiﬁed
as the energy diﬀerence between HOMO and LUMO peaks of
the ﬁnite oligomer in Figure S4), in accordance with the band
gap value of 0.2 eV calculated for an inﬁnite polymer 4 in the
gas phase (Figure 5). These theoretical energy gaps are in line
with the experimental observations, considering the typical
underestimation of DFT computed band gaps.36 Furthermore,
DFT gas phase calculations for the inﬁnite polymer revealed
that 4 is spin-polarized with spin density antiferromagnetically
located at the ﬁve-membered ring apexes (Figure 5a).
Additionally, we found that the methine carbons at the ﬁve-
membered ring apexes contribute to the lower conduction
band and the second half of the upper valence band (Figure 5),
highlighting the role of these nonbenzenoid rings in the
electronic structure of 4. A complete assignment of the other
bands is reported in Figure S5.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the on-surface
synthesis of oligo(indenoindene) 4 via sequential aryl−aryl
coupling of p-terphenyl-based precursor 1 and cyclization of
methyl substituents. Although formation of constitutional
isomers and incomplete dehydrogenation were observed,
defect-free segments of 4 could be clearly visualized by nc-
AFM. Detailed electronic characterizations by STS and DFT
calculations revealed a low band gap and the antiferromagnetic
character of 4. Alternative monomer designs are currently
considered in our laboratories to achieve such conjugated
ladder polymers with high regioselectivity, for electronic device
applications and experimental elucidation of their magnetic
properties.

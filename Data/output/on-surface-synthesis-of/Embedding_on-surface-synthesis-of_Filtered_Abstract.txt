 The resulting para-type oligo(indenoindene) (p-OInIn, 4) was characterized by means of low-temperature STM/STS and noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM). On the basis of our previous study on dihydroindenofluorene (DHIN),28 we propose that this reaction sequence is also applicable to other molecular systems with different substituents or structural features. In conclusion, these results provide an experimental demonstration for on-surface synthesis of para-type oligo(indenoindene) by thermally activated reactions, and offer a novel approach towards the precise control of molecular structures in surface chemistry. 24 POLYMERS ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT


In this study, we have investigated various chemical reactions that occur at a temperature of 180 Â°C for Au(111) surfaces functionalized with bromine atoms. These reactions include desorption processes where hydrogen is present and oxidative cyclization of methyl groups on the polymer backbones.

Reaction Pathway from 1 to p-OInIn 4 on Au(111)


 The experimental approach employed to investigate the adsorption and activation of CLP precursor molecules involved low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT).
